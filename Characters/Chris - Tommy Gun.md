## 🕵️‍♂️ The Job That Went Wrong

**Target:** A mid-level **Concordant Exchange** official on **Virellia ([[0705]])**.
- The official was overseeing covert deals between **Concordant Exchange bankers** and **Crucible Reliquary Holdings**, laundering pilgrimage donations into offworld investments.
- The hit was commissioned anonymously, likely by rivals within Concordant Exchange or an opposing faction like **Aleris Systems Collective** who wanted to destabilize Virellian financial networks.

**The Setup:**
- The assassin infiltrated a lavish estate party on the orbital arcologies above Virellia.
- They made the kill cleanly — but on exfiltration, discovered the target wasn’t the real goal.
- The **estate contained a hidden data-vault** tied to the Crucible Gate. Their employers wanted the assassination as _cover_ for stealing it.

**The Failure:**
- Another crew — mercs hired by a rival corp — struck at the same time.
- The party descended into chaos, alarms triggered, and the assassin was cornered.
- They fought through security, but were ultimately **gunned down** near the estate’s private shuttle bay.
- Before dying, they managed to initiate their mind-backup system (standard precaution for high-risk operatives, often handled by **Obsidian Dynamics (0309)** or black clinics).

**The Aftermath:**
- The job is remembered as a **botched corporate assassination**, but the _real story_ — the data-vault theft — was buried in the cover-up.
- The assassin’s _new self_ in the VI-shell has no memory of that night, nor of the _real employer._
- Rumors still circulate in underworld circles that **someone walked away with precursor Crucible data** from that estate — and now everyone wonders if the “reborn” assassin knows more than they should.
