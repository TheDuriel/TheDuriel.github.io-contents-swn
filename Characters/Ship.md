### Atmospheric Travel Speeds

| Distance                      | 200 km/h (slow) | 800 km/h (cruise) | 3,000 km/h (dash) |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 10 km (local)                 | 3 min           | 45 s              | 12 s              |
| 50 km (local)                 | 15 min          | 3 m 45 s          | 1 min             |
| 500 km (country)              | 2 h 30 m        | 37 m 30 s         | 10 m              |
| 2,000 km (country)            | 10 h            | 2 h 30 m          | 40 m              |
| 6,000 km (continental)        | 30 h            | 7 h 30 m          | 2 h               |
| 12,000 km (cross-continental) | 60 h            | 15 h              | 4 h               |
- **Takeoff / landing / holding time:** Add 15–90 minutes for descent/approach, vertical lift, tethers, customs/clearance, and any atmospheric maneuvers. Long-range numbers above are _cruise time only_.
- **Thermal / structural limits:** Sustained dash speed (3,000 km/h) may produce plasma heating on large hulls; treat it as limited-duration. Requiring high maintenance or special shield configurations can make dash unusable in some zones.
- **Air traffic & regulations:** Near inhabited spires, bases, or Greenflow platforms, legal speed caps and forced approach corridors will slow you to “low/manoeuvre” speeds regardless of capability.
- **Stealth vs speed trade:** Going fast increases detectability (sonic booms, heat signatures). If PCs need to be covert, use the 200 km/h profile even if it’s slower.
- **Environmental hazards:** Dense cloud decks, volcanic ash, spore storms, or giant updrafts can add many minutes (or force reroute). In Nyxara-style clouds, plan for +10–50% time or aborts.
- **Fuel & range:** Big ships can do these distances but fuel consumption at dash speed may require refueling or limit return legs — treat dash legs as one-way without support.
