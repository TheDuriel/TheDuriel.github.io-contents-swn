**Filed under Seal of the Board**

**Directive No. EAR–9453**  
**Classification:** Discreet Service  
**Charge:** _To Explore and Secure_

To **Lieutenant Mister Huggins**,  
of the **Survey Corps**,  
now entered into Special Service of the Company,

By order of the Board, and under authority vested in it for the furtherance of the prosperity, security, and continuance of the Honourable India Corporation, you are hereby instructed as follows:

You shall proceed forthwith to such regions, stations, and territories as your judgment and opportunity may permit, there to **observe, inquire, and discreetly examine** all matters bearing upon the discovery of **Pre-Technological artefacts**, uncommon mechanisms, novel processes, mineral advantages, agricultural contrivances, or any other object, practice, or intelligence which may reasonably be construed as of **economic, strategic, or civilising value** to the Company.

You are granted **liberty of method and movement**, and may conduct your enquiries by such means—scientific, mercantile, diplomatic, or otherwise—as circumstances may commend, provided always that **political entanglement is avoided** and that no overt attribution of Company interest be made where prudence counsels silence.

Upon the identification of any article or intelligence of sufficient merit, you are authorised to **secure, remove, or otherwise obtain control thereof**, employing such discretion as shall prevent public alarm or interference by rival interests.

Your command shall be exercised with **limited resources**, commensurate with a Special Agent of the Corps. You may draw upon **standard requisition privileges**, subject to prior approval through established channels, and are reminded that economy of expense reflects credit upon both officer and Company.

You shall render a **full and faithful report** of your activities, discoveries, and expenditures **once every two Sol months**, or sooner should circumstances demand urgent notice.

In all matters, you are to remember that you act **not as a common adventurer**, but as a servant of the Company’s long design: the acquisition of advantage, the securing of future sustenance, and the quiet extension of influence where necessity allows.

Fail not in diligence, nor in discretion.

By order of the Board,  
and under the Company Seal,

_Secretary to the Directors_  
**The Honourable India Corporation**
