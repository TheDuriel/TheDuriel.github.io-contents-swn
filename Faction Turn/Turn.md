# Turn 0

### Trinovan Blockage
[[Trinovan Mercantile Directorate]] maintains a monopoly on southern sector shipping and merchantile activities.
[[Volyograd Free Corsairs]] have been contracted to blockade the planet to create opportunities for their employers to break that hold.
[[Virellian Concord]] and [[Aurixian Orders]] are working together to break Trinova and expand their influence.
[[Aleris Systems Collective]] and [[Aleran Technocracy]] benefit from Trinova acting as a mediator between the more faith driven half of the sector.

### The Iron Demand
[[The India Corporation]] is a people based on a series of orbital platforms, with low resources and limited population room.
They are currently sowing dissent in [[0404 - Koralis]], trying to either force the company to supply their people. Or start an all out war.

### Alien Goldrush
[[Greenflow Biotics]] is currently working with the [[Veyric Resource Group]] in a 'joint' project under the [[Aleran Technocracy]] to excavate various sites in the south of the sector.
There are however disagreements about their findings. Greenflow insists that they are best equipped, while Aleran claims right by discovery.
[[Obsidian Dynamics]] watches them like a hawk, infiltrating and preparing for the possibility of a technological risk event or alien outbreak.
