### Assets
- **System Defense Fleet (TL4)** — Patrol frigates and drone wings enforcing trade security.
- **Trade Authority Bureau** — Administrative espionage and economic manipulation network.
- **Orbital Taxation Grid** — Automated customs scanning arrays at major docking rings.
- **Privateer Charter Program** — Semi-legal bounty and interdiction contracts against unsanctioned traders.
### Notes
- The Directorate emerged from an alliance of early merchant guilds, refining companies, and port authorities who consolidated power after Trinova’s independence from earlier colonial administrations.
- Every shipment entering or leaving the Southern Arc must pass through **Trinova’s customs networks**, making them one of the wealthiest system-states in the sector.
- While efficient, the Directorate’s rule is brittle — factions within the board vie for influence, and rumors suggest some are secretly funding **pirates** or **independent mining groups** to destabilize rivals.
- Locals joke: “Nothing moves through Trinova without paying the tithe — in credits, favors, or silence.”
