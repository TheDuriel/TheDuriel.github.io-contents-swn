# Surprise Rounds
When engaging a ship that is fully surprised, eg. no hands on deck or unsuspecting of hostile action. Perform one full turn with 5CP, as if it was your first. Before moving on to normal initiative. - For example after pulling up to a vessel on standby and going 'full broadsides'.

When engaging a ship that is unaware, but ready for combat. Perform a turn with 2CP, as if it was your first. Then proceed to initiative. - For example to take a potshot after outmaneuvering a vessel already on lookout for hostiles.
# Initiative
For each vessel, roll 1d8 + ship speed. Go from highest to lowest. Break ties in the players favor, or reroll.
# Distance
Ships that are in combat are assumed to be within firing distance of one another until they disengage. You are either in range to be a threat. Or too far away for anything but remote scanners to pick each other up.

If a vessel breaks distance, eg. it escapes using the corresponding action, then combat ends and it can no longer be attacked. And pursuers can no longer attempt to catch up. Unless the vessel specifically decides to stop moving and effectively allows them to. This then starts a new initiative cycle.
# Cover
Space installations and objects may act as cover, providing a penalty to hit. Generally, assume a -2 penalty for an asteroid field or debris cloud, and -4 when in tight quarters where both combatants are weaving around hard cover. Eg. Ducking behind another space craft.
# Departments
There are five departments. A PC can be in charge of as many departments as is required so that all departments are manned. Multiple PCs can man the same department together. Eg. One directs, the other executes.
The departments are: Captain, Bridge/Pilot, Gunnery, Comms, and Engineering.
# Command Points
Every turn begins with 5 command points.
Command points are lost at the end of the turn.
# Time
Turns represent between 5-10 minutes in most cases. A close quarters dogfight between fighters, might take place in 2 minute intervals instead.
# Actions
PCs can take as many station actions per turn as they want. But each Action consumes CP while doing so. Some actions are limited to once per turn, for the entire ship.
Performing an action in one station, means that they can not perform an action in a different station that turn.
Eg. A gunner must stay a gunner until their next turn.
General Actions are special, and always prevent a PC from taking additional actions that turn.
