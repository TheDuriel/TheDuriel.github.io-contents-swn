## Factions Likely Involved in Creation & Maintenance

1. **Aleris Systems Collective ([[0105 - Aleris]] Aleris)**
    - **Involvement:** As the sector’s academic-technocratic hub, Aleris would absolutely experiment with **neural mapping, cognitive storage, and VI frameworks**.
    - **Role:** Likely the source of the _original_ technology — though strictly experimental.
    - **Spin:** They insist it’s “research only,” not meant for practical immortality.
2. **Obsidian Dynamics ([[0309 - Koryth]] Koryth anomaly)**
    - **Involvement:** Shadow-researchers in precursor relics; they may have cracked part of the code needed to stabilize uploads.
    - **Role:** Could secretly sponsor the PC’s creation — or attempt to reclaim them as a “lost asset.”
    - **Spin:** They don’t see VIs as “people,” just tools.
3. **Greenflow Biotics ([[0207 - Malyth]] Malyth Prime)**
    - **Involvement:** More biologically oriented, but dabbling in **bio-synthetic neural scaffolding** to host uploads.
    - **Role:** May provide the android body or life-support substrate.
    - **Spin:** For them, a mind upload is the ultimate “biotech prototype” — a fusion of code and flesh.
4. **Crucible Reliquary Holdings ([[0505 - Aurix]] Aurix)**
    - **Involvement:** Religious custodians of the Crucible Gate. Their interest comes from a spiritual angle: is an uploaded mind a “soul” or a “ghost”?
    - **Role:** Might _sustain_ such tech in a controlled monastery-lab, seeing it as either divine proof or heretical temptation.
    - **Spin:** Officially denounce uploads, but secretly keep them for “theological study.”

## Factions Likely Opposed to VI Existence

1. **Koralis Senate & Agro-Collective ([[0404 - Koralis]] Koralis)**
    - Practical, conservative, resource-focused.
    - See mind uploads as **“resource thieves”**: consuming infrastructure but contributing no new bodies, no labor, no children.
    - They would lobby to outlaw them.
2. **Virellian Concord ([[0705 - Virellia]] Virellia)**
    - Aristocratic and obsessed with legitimacy.
    - Uploads threaten **inheritance, lineage, and political succession** — what if an old noble just reappears in an android body?
    - Likely to push for legal rulings declaring uploads “non-persons.”
3. **Valdoran League ([[0004 - Valdora]] Valdora)**
    - A cultural bloc tied heavily to agrarian, guild-based values.
    - They distrust “soulless copies,” seeing them as dangerous abominations that don’t respect the cycle of life and death.
    - They would refuse to recognize VI rights.
4. **Verdant Strains ([[0208 - Emerald Grave]].2 & jungle systems)**
    - Animist, jungle-tribal outlook.
    - Consider uploads to be **“ghosts in stolen shells.”**
    - May react violently if one is discovered in their territory.

## Ambiguous / Divided Factions

- **Pilgrim’s Star Logistics ([[0505 - Aurix]] Aurix)**
    - Practical merchants. If uploads can _legally_ operate ships without requiring life support, they’d be all for it — but not if it jeopardizes contracts.
- **Virellia Spire Media ([[0705 - Virellia]])**
    - Fascinated by the **narrative drama** of a returned dead person. Some factions of Spire Media would promote uploads as revolutionary “human stories,” others would spread panic about soulless machines.

## Narrative Tensions for the PC

- **Legal Status:**
    - Some systems will legally register the PC as **“property”** (an asset of the corp that made them).
    - Others may recognize them as a **“civil entity”** — but not as the same person they once were.
- **Religious Debate:**
    - Aurix and Verdant Strains may treat the PC as a walking heresy.
    - Crucible Orders could split between _protecting_ or _destroying_ them.
- **Corporate Greed:**
    - Whoever funded the project may **claim ownership** of the PC, framing them as stolen IP.
    - Rival corps want to dissect them to replicate the process.
- **Personal Hook:**
    - The PC’s **old identity** may still have debts, obligations, or enemies. Do those apply to them now?
