## **Tarkos Deep Extraction Platform — Standard Layout**

> **Designation:** DEP-47 “Iron Mare” Class  
> **Manufacturer:** Tarkos Extraction Limited  
> **Operational Crew:** 100 (minimum)  
> **Max Complement:** 300 (with contractors, scientists, and labor drones)  
> **Operational Roles:** Deep mineral excavation, refining, and heavy atmospheric lift.

#### **1. Command & Control Deck ("The Bridge Stack")**
- **Operations Bridge:** Central navigation and systems command, with panoramic armored windows or reinforced sensor walls.
- **Communications Tower:** Long-range comms and beacon relay; doubles as spike-drive telemetry uplink when deployed offworld.
- **Drone Coordination Bay:** Oversees fleets of remote mining drones and maintenance crawlers.
- **Emergency Override Room:** Manual control for life support, reactor, and grav-lock systems — only accessible by senior officers.
- **Observation Gallery:** Small transparent dome for external monitoring and status reviews (also a favorite smoking spot).
#### **2. Crew Deck ("The Burrow")** - Thick Biological Hazard
- **Habitation Quarters:** Compact sleeping pods and private cabins for senior staff.
- **Cafeteria & Mess Hall:** Shared dining and morale hub; famously grim Tarkos cuisine.
- **Recreation Bay:** Gym, VR lounge, and rec sim pods — often converted into makeshift bars.
- **Medical Bay / Quarantine Module:** Includes a decompression chamber and nanite scrubber bay.
- **Hydroponic Tank Farm:** Small food and oxygen generation area — half practical, half symbolic.
- **Biological Containment Module (Greenflow Variant):** Repurposed lab deck, with organic growth chambers and isolation wards.
#### **3. Core Engineering Deck ("The Forge")** - Mild Biological Hazard
- **Power Core:** Fusion or antimatter reactor, heavily shielded; gravity modulation anchors located here.
- **Environmental Systems:** Life support, filtration, and coolant management.
- **Maintenance Fabricator Bay:** 3D printers and assembly lines for spare parts, hull plating, and tools.
- **Gravity Control Hub:** Manages grav-lock anchors used to fix the platform to surfaces — or, in emergencies, to trap landing craft.
- **Access to Utility Shafts:** Narrow tunnels running vertically down to the extraction levels below.
#### **3.5 Spike Drive and Energy Core** - Radiation Hazard
- **Core Engineering Deck:** Houses the main reactor controls, power distribution, and spike drive coupling.
- **Engine Housing / Reactor Core:** The physical spike drive assembly is mounted here — protected, radiation-shielded, and near the station’s structural heart for stability.
- **Access Routes:** Maintenance shafts and coolant corridors connect upward to the Refining Deck and outward to the Cargo Docking Deck for fuel handling and stabilization.
#### **4. Refining & Processing Deck ("The Works")** - Partially Collapsed
- **Ore Processing Plants:** Smelters, crushers, separators, and volatile element scrubbers.
- **Atmospheric Vent Shafts:** Giant exhaust chimneys that vent gases, often visible from orbit.
- **Bulk Material Conveyors:** Automated belts and grav lifts that feed to storage bays.
- **Hazard Bays:** Containment areas for toxic, radioactive, or biological waste (if used for experiments).
- **Machinist Control Center:** Oversees automated refining systems; one of the loudest areas on the platform.
#### **5. Extraction & Drill Deck ("The Teeth")** - Severely Damaged
- **Primary Drill Array:** Modular drilling towers, saw arms, or plasma cutters depending on material type.
- **Survey Pit Interface:** Surface bay for deploying drill clusters or crawler rigs.
- **Subterranean Access Shafts:** Used for manual inspection or salvage — cramped and dangerous.
- **Excavation Control:** Oversees power draw, depth readouts, and geological integrity.
- **Anchor Struts:** Colossal supports that adjust to terrain or asteroid surface irregularities.
#### **6. Cargo & Docking Deck ("The Maw")**
- **Main Cargo Bay:** Bulk ore storage, shuttle loading, and resource sorting.
- **External Docking Arms:** For small freighters, survey ships, and Tarkos utility craft.
- **Grav Lock Pads:** Magnetic mooring clamps that double as security lockdowns — _capable of trapping unauthorized ships._
- **Fuel Storage Tanks:** Liquid hydrogen and helium-3 reserves; explosive if breached.
- **Maintenance Docks:** Robotic gantries and drone hangars.
#### **7. External Superstructure**
- **Sensor Masts & Atmospheric Probes:** Constantly sampling gases, minerals, and radiation.
- **Stabilizer Pylons:** Retractable legs or magnetic clamps used to stabilize the rig.
- **Storm Baffles:** Heavy armor shutters used to protect from sandstorms or asteroid debris.
- **Emergency Escape Pods:** Ejectable life modules with limited navigation capability.
- **Visual Markers:** Fluorescent orange Tarkos hazard paint and rotating warning beacons.

### **Story Potential**

- The **grav-lock** on the docking deck is tied to the central reactor’s failsafe — _cutting power disables life support too._
- The **“Teeth” deck** has partially collapsed, revealing alien ruins or biological contamination.
- The **maintenance shafts** between decks are maze-like, allowing for stealth infiltration or ambush.
- The **AI core** may misidentify the PCs as crew and assign them to dangerous repair jobs until they comply.
