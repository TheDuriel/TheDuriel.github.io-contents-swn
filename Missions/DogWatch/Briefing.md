#### **Mission Summary**
Greenflow Biotics, acting under legal agreement with Tarkos Extraction Limited, has requested licensed salvage specialists to perform a **site assessment and data recovery operation** aboard the **TKL-217 “Dogwatch”** mining platform.

2. **Assess and catalog** the condition of all operational systems and remaining cargo.
3. **Recover and extract** Tarkos’ central operational black box for audit submission.
