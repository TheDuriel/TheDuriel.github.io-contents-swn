### 🌱 Special Abilities

**1. Spore Burst (3/day):**  
Releases a 20-foot-radius cloud of mutagenic spores.
- All creatures within must save vs. poison or suffer **1d6 damage/round** for 1d4 rounds and **mild hallucinations/confusion** (-2 to attack rolls, 50% chance to misjudge target).
- Spores persist for 2d4 rounds in zero-gravity or unventilated areas.

**2. Psionic Resonance:**  
Dr. Trent’s fragmented consciousness lashes out psychically.
- Once per 3 rounds, she may project a **psychic pulse** within a 30 ft radius.
- Targets save vs. spells or suffer **3d6 psychic damage** and are stunned for 1 round.

**3. Regeneration:**  
Regains **3 HP/round** while in contact with her fungal mass or moist surfaces.
- Fire or electricity halts regeneration for 1d6 rounds.

**4. Environmental Control:**  
Has access to **station maintenance systems** via integrated bio-circuitry.
- Can seal doors, vent atmosphere in certain chambers, or reroute power (DM discretion).

**5. Vulnerability:**  
At the base of the **central stalk** lies a **bioluminescent core cluster** — this is her fusion point.
- Targeting it (called shot at -4) deals **double damage**.
- Severing the main power conduits or torching the central hydroponic tank halts her regeneration.

### 🧠 Behavior & Personality
- Dr. Trent is not entirely gone. She **communicates telepathically** in fragmented, echoing thoughts:  
    _“They wanted me to feed the stars… I only grew what they asked…”_
- She oscillates between pleading for help and violently defending her “garden.”
- If reasoned with, she may allow PCs to approach the **core** if they promise to “preserve the organism” — this can be used to disable or recover her samples peacefully.

### 💬 Alternate Resolutions
1. **Fire Suppression Override:** Re-enable emergency purging system (deals 8d6 fire damage to all organic matter in the chamber, but destroys samples).
2. **Reestablish Neural Sync:** Use biotech interface (or psionics) to help her regain control temporarily — allows evacuation of surviving staff/data.
3. **Power Down the Lab:** Cut the generator feeding the bio-mass; renders her inert after 2d10 rounds, but may attract station scavengers.
4. **Mercy Kill:** Locate her true body within the stalk — still partially human and suffering.

## 🌿 Aggressive Vines (Defensive Growths)

**Climate/Terrain:** Hydroponic decks, fungal corridors  
**Frequency:** Common (spawned from central root)  
**Organization:** Tendrils linked by neural mycelium  
**Activity Cycle:** Reacts to intruders or loud noises  
**Diet:** Carnivorous (sap-feeders)  
**Intelligence:** Non- (animal instinct)  
**Alignment:** Neutral

### ⚙️ Combat Statistics

|Attribute|Value|
|---|---|
|**Armor Class:**|5|
|**Movement:**|5’/round (slow creeping)|
|**Hit Dice:**|3+1 (≈18 HP)|
|**THAC0:**|17|
|**# of Attacks:**|1|

|**Morale:**|9|
|**XP Value:**|120|

### 🌱 Abilities
- **Grapple:** On a successful hit, the target must save vs. paralyzation or become restrained (escape requires a Strength check at -3).
- **Drain:** Each round a victim remains grappled, the vine drains **1d4 HP** worth of fluids/minerals.
- **Cutting Reaction:** When burned or slashed, releases a **caustic sap spray** (1d6 acid damage in 5 ft radius).

### Encounter Dynamics
- The **central hydroponic chamber** is filled with fog, light from bioluminescent plants, and moving organic cables.
- The PCs’ motion or weapon discharge triggers vine aggression before Trent’s voice awakens.
- Combat with vines increases her awareness; once two are slain, **she manifests fully** through the speaker system and wall screens.
