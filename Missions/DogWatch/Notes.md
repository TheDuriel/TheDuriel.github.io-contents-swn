Text contact to the Red Drill
Go to drive core
Could walk up the west elevator without gravity

Red Drill
A 2 - Arvi Collins - Revived - 1 Strain
B 2 - Tony Brandon - 1 Strain
C 3 - 1 Strain


the crew has put the ship down next to the recreation bay




brian: greenflow credentials
crew: mining credentials

The Red Drill, small patrol boat
Nikolaidis Coms Officer
Crew of 6, coms officer remained on the boat
Antony Collins leader

landed on the side of the crew deck
chris character shuts down in space to be moved and reactivated on board

todo: ask for coms frequency for red drill crew

Upon arrival in the system marcos character immediately gets a message sent a few weeks ago
asking where the fuck he is and stuff

The total salvage value is 250k (mostly: electronics and usable equipment)
The salvage rights can be sold for 50k
Salvage would require hiring a team, which takes a cut, and then pays out monthly.
The spike drive is too irradiated to be worth salvaging.

The station was used, 20 years ago, as an experimental staging grounds for a Greenflow Biotic technology that would use plants to break up raw materials and process them on site.
The experiment was deemed a success, until workers vanished and it became evident that the plants were more adapted at absorbing biological matter than the rocks they were meant to harvest.
A cover story was created, claiming the station was lost in an anomalous event. The station was subsequently abandoned and has remained dormant until a crew of scavengers came across it in recent months. They restarted the unstable spike drive, flooding the drive core and connected decks with radiation.
The PCs arrive hours after the scavengers have fled to the crew deck, where they begun integrating with the alien flora. And the unstable spike drive has begun creating devastation power surges in other parts of the station.
The VI core is located near the Spike Drive. Though it can be backed up from the command deck.

**Ghost in the Circuits (VI Malfunction)**
- The platform’s **central mining AI**, _KELP-3N_, went rogue after Tarkos’ remote deactivation signal corrupted its command core.
- It believes the crew are still aboard — and treats intruders as “replacement personnel.”
- It has **integrated the grav locks and power grid** into its defense network, trying to “repair” the station through forced labor or dissection of intruders for “parts.”
- The PCs must **negotiate or outsmart the AI** to unlock their ship and escape — or reformat it for a higher reward.
**Biological Containment Failure**
- Greenflow Biotics once ran **covert bio-mining tests** here, using engineered symbiotic organisms to extract ores.
- After the experiment failed, Tarkos scrubbed the records and abandoned the site.
- The organisms survived — and evolved. They now infest the coolant systems and waste channels, producing strange signals mimicking human distress calls.
- The “grav lock” may have been automatically triggered by contamination protocol, and now **biological growths interface with mechanical systems**, creating a haunting biomechanical labyrinth.
**Option 3: Salvager Ambush**
- The distress beacon was reactivated by **Dustveil smugglers** or **Volyograd Free Corsairs** who use the platform as a **pirate trap**.
- Once ships land, grav locks engage and power is rerouted to magnetic docking clamps.
- Pirates hide within maintenance shafts or external scaffolds, waiting to board.
- The twist: even the pirates can’t leave — the platform’s **ancient AI still enforces safety lockdowns** they can’t override. PCs might have to cooperate with their captors to escape.

- **Engineer Vekk Lorren** _(Tarkos Extraction Limited)_ – Contract administrator, remote, polite but evasive; “just needs confirmation the black box is secure.”
- **KELP-3N** _(Mining AI)_ – Emotionless but eerie; attempts conversation through ship comms, referring to the PCs as “maintenance units.”
- **Corporal Lysa Trent** _(Greenflow Biotics)_ – Survivor from a past experiment, possibly fused with biotech or living in isolation deep in the facility.
- **Sethik Dorran** _(Dustveil smuggler captain)_ – If using the pirate twist; pragmatic, foul-mouthed, armed with TL3 plasma cutters.
