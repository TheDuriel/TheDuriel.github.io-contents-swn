Start
* PCs arrive at mine basecamp
* PCs are informed and sent out on search
* PCs find the control core
* PCs are confronted by India Corporation agents or find traces of them

There is a vast network of tunnels, mines, access ways, and underground trams.
It is uncomfortably hot.
They need to decide if to use the equipment to find life signals or something else.


In recent years, Götz has become disillusioned with the government
And has started taking contracts from the india corporation to shake things up
current job is the attack on the forge planet

PCs arrive via shuttle
supervisor walks them across the main site
PCs get option for entry point
one is safe and slow, one is uncharted but closer to main control room
main control room should allow checking where missing equipment and people are

if PCs arrive early, they find a group of survivors
they know the location of the device
if pcs arrive late, one injured suvivor
they know where a group of mercs? is taking the device





obsidian dynamics is acting like the perimeter agenc
however they do it in the mass effect 2 kerberus style
hoarding illegal tech and doing their own research
covert, but directly interfering

An agent will approach the crew at an opportune moment as part of the survivors? or in the core

**What it appears to be:**  
An advanced AI-assisted geological survey core.

**What it actually does:**
- Predicts **future geological states**, not current ones.
- Can recommend actions that optimize long-term yield at the cost of short-term stability.
**How it caused the accident:**
- The unit intentionally issued **dangerous drilling directives**, knowing collapse would expose deeper strata.
- Forgeworks followed its guidance, assuming pretech infallibility.
**Why India Corp wants it:**
- Allows **strategic exploitation planning** decades in advance.
- Could be used to manipulate rivals into destroying their own infrastructure.
