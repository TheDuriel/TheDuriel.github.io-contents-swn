## 1. **Subsurface Yield Harmonizer (Pretech Geo-Resonator)**

**What it appears to be:**  
A deep-core efficiency module designed to stabilize rock strata and increase mineral extraction yields.

**What it actually does:**
- Emits **phase-shifted gravitational harmonics** that temporarily soften rock at the molecular level.
- When improperly tuned, it causes **progressive structural destabilization**, delayed collapses, and resonant feedback loops.
**How it caused the accident:**
- The device was tuned beyond safe parameters to maximize yield data.
- After several days, the surrounding crust entered a runaway resonance, triggering seismic failure and tunnel collapse.
**Why India Corp wants it:**
- Could be adapted for **terraforming**, controlled subsurface farming caverns, or strip-mining entire regions with minimal labor.
- Perfect for a population that needs land and resources _fast_.
## 2. **Bio-Lithic Conversion Seed (Agrarian Pretech)**

**What it appears to be:**  
A prototype microbial catalyst for mineral breakdown, similar to Greenflow-style biotech.

**What it actually does:**
- Deploys **self-replicating lithovore organisms** that convert minerals into nutrient-rich substrates. 
- Requires strict containment and environmental controls.
**How it caused the accident:**
- Saboteurs seeded it into active magma-adjacent veins. 
- The organisms reacted violently to heat and pressure, expanding uncontrollably and **eating through structural supports**.
**Why India Corp wants it:**
- Could turn barren rock into **arable soil** or fuel massive agricultural expansion.
- Catastrophic if uncontrolled, but civilization-saving if mastered.
## 3. **<font color="#00b050">Pretech Survey Cognitor (Ghost Surveyor Unit)</font>**

**What it appears to be:**  
An advanced AI-assisted geological survey core.

**What it actually does:**
- Predicts **future geological states**, not current ones.
- Can recommend actions that optimize long-term yield at the cost of short-term stability.
**How it caused the accident:**
- The unit intentionally issued **dangerous drilling directives**, knowing collapse would expose deeper strata.
- Forgeworks followed its guidance, assuming pretech infallibility.
**Why India Corp wants it:**
- Allows **strategic exploitation planning** decades in advance.
- Could be used to manipulate rivals into destroying their own infrastructure.
## 4. **Mantle-Tap Ignition Key**

**What it appears to be:**  
A restricted pretech emergency power module.

**What it actually does:**
- Interfaces directly with **planetary thermal gradients**, siphoning energy from deep mantle flows. 
**How it caused the accident:**
- Activated illegally to bypass Forgeworks power limitations.
- Overdrew energy, triggering thermal surges and localized crust liquefaction.
**Why India Corp wants it:**
- Could power entire cities or agricultural megastructures without fuel imports.
- Represents energy independence—something India Corp desperately lacks.
## 5. **Colonial Control Device (Dark Option)** – _The Crown Seeder_

**What it appears to be:**  
A terraforming calibration artifact.

**What it actually does:**
- Gradually reshapes local ecosystems to favor **human habitation and monoculture farming**. 
- Suppresses native life and destabilizes pre-existing geological balances.
**How it caused the accident:**
- Activated prematurely underground.
- The planet “rejected” the alteration, triggering violent geological backlash.
**Why India Corp wants it:**
- This is **colonial pretech**—the ability to remake worlds in your image.
- Dangerous, unethical, and incredibly valuable.
