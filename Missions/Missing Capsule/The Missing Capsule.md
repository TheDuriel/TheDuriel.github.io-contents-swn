# The Missing Capsule (Nyxara [[0202]].1)

A survey capsule, launched from orbit by an [[Aleran Technocracy]] research craft, crashed into the **Twilight Lowlands** of Nyxara. The capsule contains **data cores and precursor fragments** collected from a spire filament chamber. Whoever controls it could leverage the information for science, power, or profit.

### **Which factions are involved?**
- **[[Aleran Technocracy]] ([[0105]]):** The capsule was theirs. They want it back intact for research and prestige. They‚Äôll pay well but insist on discretion. 
- **[[Obsidian Dynamics]]:** Their agents intercepted transmissions about the capsule. They want it first, to plunder for precursor tech.
- **[[Greenflow Biotics]]:** Claim the capsule violates their monopoly on ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Nyxaran research. They‚Äôve dispatched a security team to seize it.
- **Nyxari Lowland Tribes:** Locals see the capsule as a **falling star**, a dangerous omen. Some worship it, others seek to destroy it.

### **Who is the PCs contact on the planet?**
- **Dr. Lyssa Veylan** ‚Äì Aleran field scientist.
    - **Faction:** Aleran Technocracy
    - **Personality:** Nervous, brilliant, too honest for her own good.
    - **Role:** She hires the PCs and provides coordinates of the crash site, but her intel is **12 hours old** ‚Äî things have already shifted on the ground.

### **What other characters may they encounter?**
- **Karo ‚ÄúThree-Hands‚Äù Myrek** ‚Äì Dustveil Syndicate smuggler operating in the lowlands. Offers navigation help through fungal groves‚Ä¶ for a cut.
- **Sister Alira** ‚Äì A pilgrim of the Crucible, interpreting the capsule as a holy sign. She might help or hinder depending on PCs‚Äô actions.
- **Sergeant Marrok** ‚Äì Greenflow Biotics security commander, leading a corporate recovery squad. Suspicious and heavily armed.
- **Teyna Hollowborn** ‚Äì Leader of a mutated lowland tribe. Her people think the capsule is cursed and will attempt to drive everyone away.

### **What environmental and man-made challenge is in their way?**

- **Environmental Hazards:**
    - Fungal forests that release **paralytic spores** when disturbed.
    - Swarms of spire-winged predators nesting near the capsule site.
    - The **Twilight Zone** of Nyxara is damp, low-visibility, and filled with treacherous sinkholes.
- **Man-Made Obstacles:**
    - Automated **Aleran survey drones** that went rogue when the capsule crashed; they now defend the site against anyone.
    - A competing **Obsidian Dynamics team** setting up sensor jammers to mask their retrieval.
    - Local **lowland traps** ‚Äî concealed pitfall snares and fungal fire-pits around the capsule site.
### **Potential Twists**

1. **Capsule Integrity Compromised:** The capsule cracked on impact, leaking precursor artifacts into the soil. The PCs may have to contain them before recovery.
2. **Data Core Self-Encrypts:** The capsule is **actively rewriting itself** (similar to the signal on Verdancia), suggesting precursor tech contamination.
3. **Obsidian Dynamics Agent Inside:** When the PCs reach the site, they find an Obsidian agent already embedded in the capsule‚Äôs systems ‚Äî maybe even offering to **ally temporarily**.
4. **Lowland Hostility:** The capsule has already been claimed by Teyna‚Äôs Hollowborn tribe, who see it as a **gift of power**. Taking it may ignite open war with the locals.
5. **Greenflow Sting:** The entire job is a Greenflow setup to expose Aleran interference ‚Äî meaning the PCs are now on the hook as **corporate pawns**.
6. **The Capsule Moves:** The capsule‚Äôs onboard AI thrusters reactivated after impact, and it is slowly dragging itself deeper into the fungal jungle.
7. **Dr. Veylan‚Äôs Secret:** The Aleran contact knew about the risks ‚Äî she may have **deliberately leaked intel** to multiple parties to force a recovery at any cost.


### üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è **The Coral Wraiths Crew**

A small, semi-stranded pirate band operating out of a hidden mooring carved into a dead coral pillar. Their ships are jury-rigged and fungal-corroded, but their cunning (and desperation) keeps them alive.
