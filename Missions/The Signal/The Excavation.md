**Who is running this excavation?**
- The site is operated by **[[Greenflow Biotics]]**, officially under contract with the **[[Veyric Resource Group]]**.
- Greenflow staff are outwardly “academic researchers,” but most are corporate scientists with heavy security presence.
- Archaeologists from **Aleris ([[0105 - Aleris]])** provide technical expertise — but are constantly monitored to prevent leaks.

**Who lays claim to the find?**
- **Koralis Senate** claims political ownership, arguing it falls within their food/resource bloc.
- **Greenflow Biotics** insists on corporate IP ownership.
- Local **[[Verdant Strains]] tribes** denounce the dig as desecration of an ancestral tomb-forest.
- Result: a legal/political standoff — Koralis “owns” it, Greenflow controls it, Verdant Strains resist it, and Aleris just wants the science.

## The Job

**Who is interested in the sample (the PCs’ employer)?**
- **Obsidian Dynamics**, the black-ops precursor tech hunters.
- They see the **self-modifying signal** as potentially **a living code fragment** — a precursor AI seed or weapon protocol.
- Their motive: if it can rewrite storage media, it might be able to **rewrite spike-drives, nav charts, or even biological systems**.
- They provide the PCs with:
    - **Forged Greenflow contractor credentials.**
    - **Purchase certification papers** marking them as authorized couriers for “sample transfer.”
    - Quiet instructions: _“Don’t analyze it. Don’t open it. Bring it home.”_

## What Might Go Wrong

1. **Corporate Paranoia:**
    - Greenflow maintains **biometric locks** on all samples. Forged credentials may fail under scrutiny.
    - Their security teams (TL4 trained) are suspicious and quick to assume espionage.
2. **The Signal’s Behavior:**
    - The storage medium is in **quarantine isolation**, but the signal might attempt to **propagate to PCs’ gear** — spike drives, datapads, even neural implants.
    - If not contained, the “sample” could rewrite their own systems during the heist.
3. **Verdant Strain Interference:**
    - Local jungle tribes may raid the surface base, seeing the signal as a **forest-spirit curse** that should be buried.
    - PCs could be caught between tribal assault and corporate defense.
4. **Aleran Scientists:**
    - Some of the Aleris researchers suspect the sample’s importance. One might secretly approach the PCs, demanding they **smuggle a duplicate** for Aleris — risking exposure.
5. **Obsidian Dynamics Double-Cross:**
    - Even if the PCs succeed, their employer may want to **“sanitize witnesses.”**
    - Or worse: their “fake credentials” might actually **flag them as suspects**, ensuring Greenflow clamps down once the job is done.

## 🎲 Possible Outcomes

- **Success but Contamination:** PCs extract the signal, but one of their systems gets “infected” by the code — slowly rewriting until it awakens.
- **Corporate Espionage Spiral:** Multiple corps (Aleris, Koralis, Greenflow, Obsidian) all show up, forcing PCs into corporate intrigue.
- **Cultural Fallout:** Helping the Verdant Strains bury the find instead could make them heroes to locals — and enemies to the corps.
- **The Signal Reactivates:** If exposed outside quarantine, the signal may begin **rewriting nearby spike lanes** or even activating the ruins themselves.

# Other

There are smugglers supplying the tribal resistance with Tl3 weaponry from a nearby system.

# 🏗️ **Base Layout: The Verdancia Dig**

Think of the site as a **sprawling jungle installation**, broken into semi-isolated nodes connected by dirt tracks, mag-rail trams, or crawler shuttles. Travel between areas can take **10 minutes to an hour** depending on distance, security checks, or jungle interference.

## 1. **Landing & Logistics Zone (“The Pad”)**

- **Primary Function:** Shuttle pad, cargo depot, customs.
- **Details:**
    - A large cleared jungle plateau reinforced with ferrocrete.
    - **Landing pad towers** with Greenflow customs officers who scan cargo and check contractor credentials.
    - Adjacent **supply hangars** with crawler transports that ferry goods deeper into the jungle.
    - **Smugglers’ inroads:** Black-market contacts sometimes bribe pad crews to get shipments “mis-logged.”

## 2. **Surface Base / Hab Complex (“The Hive”)**

- **Primary Function:** Central living, admin, and barracks hub.
- **Details:**
    - Prefab domes and towers linked by catwalks and tunnels.
    - **Greenflow admin offices** (with biometrics and sample records).
    - **Security garrison** (80–100 staff, armed TL4).
    - **Aleris researcher dormitories**, cramped and heavily monitored.
    - Mess halls, infirmary, rec halls (good for blending in under forged credentials).
- **PC Angle:** Fake credentials likely get checked here first; security patterns can be scouted from the mess.

## 3. **Observation Station Alpha (O.S.-A)**

- **Primary Function:** Monitoring ruins and surface signals.
- **Details:**
    - A jungle-overwatch platform, canopy-high, with long-range comms and seismic sensors.
    - Staffed by Greenflow technicians who report all readings back to The Hive.
- **PC Angle:** Provides a line-of-sight view of the ruins. PCs could cut or falsify data here to cover their heist.

## 4. **The Primary Dig (“The Mouth”)**

- **Primary Function:** Ruin entry point and excavation zone.
- **Details:**
    - A yawning chasm carved into vine-wrapped stone ruins.
    - Ringed with **scaffolding, cranes, and floodlights**.
    - Small encampments of Verdant Strains tribes sometimes appear nearby, harassing workers.
- **Security:** High — checkpoints, drones, and both Greenflow and Lyranth Forgeworks contractors.
- **PC Angle:** The most direct but most dangerous path to the sample.

## 5. **Quarantine Vault (“The Box”)**

- **Primary Function:** Secure storage of anomalous finds.
- **Details:**
    - Buried underground in reinforced bunkers, accessible via tram from the dig.
    - Heavily shielded lab with double airlocks, biometrics, and redundant power.
    - Sample containing the **self-modifying signal** is held here in **air-gapped, physically isolated storage**.
- **PC Angle:** This is the **objective zone**. The fake courier certification is meant to get them here. But biometric checks and surveillance mean subtle infiltration is risky.

## 6. **Outer Jungle Fringe**

- **Primary Function:** Wild buffer zone around the facility.
- **Details:**
    - Patrol routes circle the site, but jungle growth makes full security impossible.
    - Verdant Strains guerrillas slip through these areas to stage attacks.
    - **Smugglers’ drop points** for TL3 arms shipments.
- **PC Angle:** Possible infiltration/exfiltration routes; risky due to wildlife and tribal scouts.

# 🕹️ **Base Dynamics & Play Flow**

- Ships land at **The Pad** → all cargo/personnel processed through **The Hive** → observation teams monitor from **O.S.-A** → heavy traffic between **The Mouth** (dig site) and **The Box** (quarantine vault).
- Greenflow prioritizes **control of information**: samples move under guard, and all outsiders are watched closely.
- Getting from pad to vault legitimately takes **hours**; speed requires skipping checkpoints, drawing suspicion.

# 🎲 Adventure Levers (for PCs)

1. **Smuggler Angle:** PCs might link up with smugglers arming the Verdant Strains — smugglers could be a distraction or a betrayal.
2. **Scientist Leak:** An Aleris archaeologist wants the PCs to smuggle _a duplicate copy_ of the signal. This complicates the job.
3. **Tribal Interference:** A Verdant Strains raid could erupt mid-job, collapsing security structure and creating opportunities — or chaos.
4. **Signal Glitch:** The AI-code might “ping” PCs’ datapads or implants during the heist, risking exposure before they even leave.
5. **Escape Pressure:** Even if the PCs succeed, **Greenflow pursuers** will likely be dispatched once the sample vanishes.
