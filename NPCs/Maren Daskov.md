### Notes
- **Calculating & Polished:** Maren speaks with precise diction and keeps a flawless professional veneer, using finance jargon as both shield and weapon.
- **Pragmatic Opportunist:** Views every deal as a potential long-term investment — in people as much as in credits. Might offer “favors” with quiet interest attached.
- **Cynical Idealist:** Secretly believes the Exchange is the only true stabilizing force in the sector — everything else is chaos. But she’s grown jaded from watching people default, disappear, or die in deep space.
* **Quirk:** Keeps a small holo of every ship she’s financed — not for sentiment, but as a “fleet ledger of the living and the lost.”
