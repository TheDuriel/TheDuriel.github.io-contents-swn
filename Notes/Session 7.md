Sir Götz von Berlich
Has a metal arm with monofillamnet blade
Jump enhancements
Energy shield
There is a code of honor in his company
But they operate as a private military mercenary group

The Black Fist Mercenaries
[[SMS Colditz]]
[[Götz von Berlich]]

**Strategy:**
Uses stealth drone for recon and emergency melee stun
Then jumps in with grapnel launcher
And finally stabs you to death
Alternative is combat rile

Götz was looking to collect on a bounty for [[Chris - Tommy Gun]] however upon finding out the upload situation. He wants to get the data core intact (head) and fleece it for secrets from when Tommy was active.
