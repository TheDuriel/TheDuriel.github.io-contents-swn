# Valdora

**Star:**
- Yellow-white main-sequence star, slightly larger than Sol.
- Stable luminosity, supports multiple habitable worlds and robust agricultural zones.
- Mild solar flares occur every 6–7 years, occasionally affecting orbital communications.

**Planets & Features:**
1. **Valdora Prime (0004.1) – Capital World**
    - TL4 industrial/agricultural planet.
    - Surface: Fertile plains, river valleys, and scattered mountain ranges.
    - Population: ~3.2 billion, mostly concentrated in orbital city clusters and major surface cities.
    - Government: **Planetary Council** — representative assembly overseeing industrial output, agriculture, and trade regulations.
    - Economy: Exports refined metals, grain, and mid-tech manufactured goods to neighboring systems.
    - Infrastructure: Orbital shipyards, orbital habitats, spaceports, and automated orbital defense platforms.

2. **Minerva (0004.2) – Industrial Satellite**
    - TL4 automated factories and orbital refineries.
    - Mined resources from asteroid belts are processed here before shipping to Valdora Prime.
    - Mostly unmanned, controlled via secure orbital AI nodes.

3. **Tessara (0004.3) – Research & Observatory Planet**
    - TL4 research world hosting planetary observatories and spike-navigation labs.
    - Population: ~500,000 scientists, engineers, and staff.
    - Notable Feature: Home to a precision spike-drive calibration array used by commercial and military ships.

4. **Asteroid Belt – Valdora Ring**
    - Rich in iron, nickel, and minor pretech debris.
    - Orbital mining stations and a single small outpost maintain claim over the valuable materials.

### 🚀 Trade & Route Connections

- **Major Spike Routes:**
    - [[0004]] → [[0204]] (Central Spine, East-West)
    - [[0004]] → [[0003]] → [[0005]] (North-South minor connections)
- **Neighboring Systems:**
    - [[0003]] – Dustveil (minor contact, trade in rare commodities)
    - [[0005]] – Ember Dwarf (light traffic for technology and supplies)
    - [[0204]] – Dyson Fragment (strategic connection via central spine)

### 🛡️ Security & Military

- **Valdora Orbital Defense Grid:**
    - Automated missile batteries and spike-interdiction sensors.
    - Patrols maintain safe spike entry and suppress piracy near trade lanes.
- **Local Militia & Shipyards:**
    - Equipped with TL4 frigates and light corvettes.
    - Rapid deployment capability to neighboring systems in case of trade disputes or frontier unrest.

### 🧭 Adventure Hooks

1. **Trade Dispute:** Neighboring low-tech worlds attempt to bypass Valdora’s export taxes. PCs may be hired to enforce or sabotage trade routes.
2. **Corporate Espionage:** Rival corporations send teams to steal research from Tessara labs or Minerva’s orbital factories.
3. **Pretech Discovery:** Mining in Valdora Ring uncovers a fragment of TL5+ technology, triggering secretive inspection from the planetary council.
4. **Frontier Threat:** Pirates or cultists operating in Dustveil ([[0003]]) use warp holes to threaten Valdora Prime’s shipping lanes.

### 🌟 Flavor & Setting Notes

- **Culture:** Industrious, trade-focused, and politically moderate.
- **Environment:** Cities heavily rely on orbital infrastructure; rural areas are highly productive, but retain traditional farming practices.
- **Politics:** Council includes representatives from major corporations, agricultural guilds, and research institutions — creating frequent internal debates.
- **Society:** Valdora maintains a **stable, moderate tech society**, making it a hub for TL3–TL4 neighboring systems to rely on for trade and governance.
