# Aleris

**Star:**
- White F-type main-sequence star, slightly hotter than Sol.
- Stable with minimal solar activity; occasional flares disrupt local spike comms.
- Supports multiple planets, orbital stations, and asteroid belts.

### **Planets & Features**

**1. Aleris Prime (0105.1) – Capital & Research World**
- **Tech Level:** 4
- **Population:** ~3.1 billion
- **Surface:** Temperate continents with sprawling research cities, plains, and highland plateaus.
- **Government:** **Technocratic Council** — council of scientists, engineers, and administrators governs planetary and regional affairs.
- **Economy:**
    - Specializes in research, spike navigation, sensor development, and precision engineering.
    - Exports: research data, calibrated spike charts, scientific equipment, and technical expertise.
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Orbital habitats for researchers and administrative staff.
    - Starports and orbital trade stations.
    - Sensor arrays and spike-lane calibration stations.

**2. Veyric Belt (0105.2) – Asteroid Mining & Refinery Zone**
- Mining colonies extract iron, nickel, and silicates.
- TL4 automated refineries produce materials for orbital construction and nearby TL4 hubs.

**3. Lyssara (0105.3) – Orbital Research Station**
- TL4 laboratory station for spike navigation, astrophysics, and precursor artifact studies.
- Population: ~450,000 scientists, technicians, and support personnel.
- Equipped with spike-drive calibration arrays and advanced sensor grids.

**4. Minor Moons (0105.4 & 0105.5)**
- Host orbital defense platforms and comms satellites.
- Primarily automated, lightly staffed for maintenance and security.

### **Trade & Route Connections**

- **Major Spike Routes:**
    - North–South Spine: [[0004]] → [[0105]] → [[0205]] → [[0305]]
    - Connects minor routes: [[0106]] → [[0107]] for frontier trade
- **Neighboring Systems:**
    - [[0004]] – Valdora (industrial and agricultural hub)
    - [[0106]] – Havor (low-tech fishing and coastal settlements)
    - [[0204]] – Dyson Fragment (research and minor commercial partner)

### **Security & Military**

- **Orbital Defense Grid:**
    - TL4 frigates and corvettes patrol spike lanes and research arrays.
    - Automated missile batteries protect orbital stations and sensitive research facilities.
- **Local Enforcement:**
    - Technocratic Council maintains internal order, monitors trade traffic, and ensures secure handling of pretech or sensitive materials.

### **Adventure Hooks**

1. **Research Sabotage:** Rival TL4 factions or corporations attempt to steal or destroy experimental spike-drive tech.
2. **Artifact Discovery:** Mining in Veyric Belt uncovers a fragment of TL5+ tech; PCs may be hired to retrieve or protect it.
3. **Spike Calibration Emergency:** Sensor arrays or calibration stations fail, endangering regional spike traffic; PCs may need to investigate or repair.
4. **Diplomatic Intrigue:** Neighboring systems contest research contracts or claim pretech finds; PCs could mediate or sabotage.

### **Flavor & Setting Notes**

- **Culture:** Highly academic, research-focused, with pragmatic governance.
- **Politics:** Technocratic Council emphasizes scientific merit and regional coordination.
- **Environment:** Urban research centers dominate the surface, complemented by orbital labs and asteroid mining operations.
- **Society:** Aleris acts as a **knowledge and navigation hub** for neighboring TL3–4 systems, providing spike expertise, research infrastructure, and regional coordination.
