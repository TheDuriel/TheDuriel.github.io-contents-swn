**System:** Binary: a pale orange K-dwarf (primary) with a small cool companion (red dwarf). The pair give the system long stable seasons but unpredictable windshear patterns in the outer atmosphere of inner worlds.

**Role:** A marginal, little-traveled system prized by xenobiologists, biominers, and strange-in-the-sky cultists. Navigation is tricky for large craft due to atmospheric turbulence and charged particle storms in the upper atmosphere.

**Notable bodies:**
- **2020.1 ‚Äî Nyxara (THE SKY-SPIRES)** ‚Äî the signature world (details below).
- **2020.2 ‚Äî Graymoon** ‚Äî Airless rocky moon with salvage and minor mining camps.
- **2020.3 ‚Äî Lattice Belt** ‚Äî a narrow belt of glassy asteroids containing unusual crystalline deposits used for biotech stabilizers.

## üåç Nyxara ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Sky-Spires‚Äù (2020.1)

**Overview:**  
A mid-sized planet with a thin but dense cloud layer at ~8‚Äì12 km altitude that never clears. The actual ground ‚Äî vast, drowned lowlands and ancient basins ‚Äî sits perpetually below this cloud deck in a dim, twilight environment. Rising out of the clouds are **cathedral-scale coral pillars** (the _sky-spires_), hundreds to thousands of meters across and up to 30‚Äì50 km tall, their tips punching through the cloud layer into clear, starry air. From orbit Nyxara looks like a forest of bone pillars capped with glittering mist.

**Why ‚Äúcoral‚Äù?**  
The spires are living structures: layered calciform and chitinous growths produced by vast sessile organisms. They secrete mineral composites that build over centuries. Their surfaces are colonized by terraces of flora, hanging gardens, and small ecosystems. On the thin, twilight surface, life clings in cryptic forms ‚Äî blind crustaceans, bioluminescent mats, and subterranean fungal networks.

**Signature features**
- **Sky-Spines:** Gigantic living pillars. Each has terraces, caverns and a distinct microbiome. Some spines are hollow and can be entered vertically by climbers or elevators, others are pitted with venomous lagoons near their bases (where sea meets pillar).
- **Cloud Deck:** Thick permanent stratus; above it the sky is calm and navigable. Most large landings and long-range observation are done from atop spire caps that breach the clouds.
- **Sunken Lowlands:** Surface below the clouds ‚Äî a patchwork of brackish seas, black salt flats and fossilized forests ‚Äî bathed in perpetual blue-grey twilight, with low-energy ecosystems adapted to low light.
- **Wind-harvesters & Sky-platforms:** Floating platforms and tethered skycraft harvest atmospheric plankton and draw energy from high-altitude winds; they also service spire caps.
- **Spiregroves:** Collections of small, clustered pillars whose bases share cave systems and strange sympathetic neural networks ‚Äî some Aleran scientists suspect communication between spires.

**Economy & Resources**
- **Biocrystals / Plasmagrain:** Organic-mineral deposits in spire tissue valuable to biotech and spike-stabilizer research. Highly sought after by biopharma and navtech corporations.
- **Atmospheric Plankton:** Harvested by sky platforms for exotic compounds and food production.
- **Precursor-like strata:** Occasional metallic filaments embedded deep in the oldest spires ‚Äî prime targets for salvage and Obsidian Dynamics.

**Factions & Presence**
- **[[Aleris Systems Collective]] ([[0105]])** ‚Äî research stations and long-range sensor towers on select spire caps. They study spire growth, neural networks and potential communications. They push for open scientific study.
- **[[Greenflow Biotics]]** ‚Äî corporate bioprospecting concessions for the extraction and commercialization of biocrystals; run several heavily guarded sky platforms.
- **[[Obsidian Dynamics]]** ‚Äî shadow teams and cutouts searching older spires for precursor filaments; suspected of covert operations and theft.
- **Sky-Clans (native)** ‚Äî small human/indigenous groups and former colonists living on lower terraces and in spire caves; they practice spire-cultism, harvest spire fruit, and oppose heavy extraction.
- **Independent Harvesters** ‚Äî floating fleets of small firms and freelancers that sell plankton and low-grade crystal on the black market.

**Typical tech / TL:** Mixed. Surface communities often TL1‚Äì3, spire caps and sky platforms TL4. Aleris and Greenflow use TL4 labs and tethered elevators to move staff.

## ‚ö† Hazards & Special Rules (GM use)

- **Cloud Deck Barrier:** Large craft must land on spire caps or use specialized tardigrade shuttles to pierce the deck in turbulent funnels. Landing on the clouds without a cap risks being swept away. Treat cloud passage as a risky maneuver (possible hull damage or navigational drift).
- **Vertical Travel:** Moving from spire cap to base is vertical traversal. Expeditions need climbing gear, tethered lifts, or elevator shafts. Bottom-to-top trips can take hours to days.
- **Coral Toxins & Spores:** Disturbing spire tissue can release neural spores that induce hallucinations or temporary psionic sensitivity. Decontamination and PPE required.
- **Spire Sentience Hypothesis:** High-sympathy research indicates spires may exhibit slow, system-wide responses to damage (e.g., redirecting nutrient flows). Massive harvesting can trigger coordinated defensive measures (acidic exudates, magnetic disturbances).
- **Precursor Interference:** Precursor filaments sometimes cause local anomalies: time-slips, instrument noise, or faint humming in the lowlands.

## üåø Ecology & Culture

- **Sky-Farming:** Citizens of sky platforms farm fast-growing algae and atmospheric plankton; their diets are rich in plankton paste and spire-fruits.
- **Spire-Cultists:** Some Sky-Clans venerate the spires as ancestors; they tattoo their skin with spiral glyphs and practice vertical pilgrimages up the pillar terraces.
- **Lowland Dwellers:** People and animals surviving below the cloud deck are adapted to low light ‚Äî pale, slow-growing, often with bioluminescent symbionts.

## ‚õè Adventure Hooks & Story Seeds

1. **The Cap Collapse:** A mid-size sky cap platform goes dark; Aleris hires the PCs to board and investigate. Greenflow wants to secure its old extraction rig inside ‚Äî but the spire is responding by exuding a hallucinogenic fog that makes the crew turn against each other.
2. **Filament Heist:** Obsidian Dynamics offers a fat payout to retrieve a metallic filament from the inner ribs of an ancient spire. Aleris wants custody. The spire network may ‚Äúremember‚Äù the attack.
3. **Cloud-Funnel Rescue:** A small ferry carrying children from a lowland village gets lost in a funnel storm inside the cloud deck. The PCs must perform a daring vertical rescue.
4. **Sky-Clan Rebellion:** The Sky-Clans sabotage a Greenflow harvester after the company drains a local spire pond. PCs can broker peace, aid the clans, or help Greenflow crush the resistance.
5. **The Singing Spire:** One spire begins emitting harmonic tones that interfere with spike navigation across the system. Pilgrims arrive, cults form, and the Crucible-interested factions sniff a connection.
6. **Harvesters‚Äô Cup:** A violent race of sky-skiffs between independent harvesters turns deadly when someone poisons the runoff ‚Äî who benefits from a sudden shortage of plankton?
