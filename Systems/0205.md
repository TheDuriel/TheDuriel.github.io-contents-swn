# **Prospektor’s Rest**

**Star Type:** Binary system — a bright F-type primary (_Solara_) and a dim M-type red dwarf companion (_Ashen_). Their overlapping gravity wells and radiation patterns make navigation turbulent, particularly near the inner system.

**Sector Role:** A wild frontier of dueling prospectors, outlaw gangs, and boomtown colonies scrambling to get rich off a recent mineral discovery.

## 🪐 Major Worlds & Belts

### 1. **Brass Reach (0205.2)** — _“The Gold Rush World”_
- **Type:** Arid terrestrial planet with vast badlands, mesas, and canyon networks.
- **Climate:** Dry, thin atmosphere, scattered oases, violent dust storms.
- **Current State:** A **massive rush of settlers, prospectors, and corporate surveyors** after the discovery of vast veins of **quantum-gold (exotic crystalline ore with precursor tech resonance)**.
- **Culture:**
    - Frontier towns built from prefabs, scrap, and wrecked mining rigs.
    - Local law enforcement is thin; most settlements rely on private gunslingers or mercs.
    - Combines classic Western “boomtown” feel with **Mad Max-style salvage gangs** running the wastelands in jury-rigged land haulers.
- **Conflict:**
    - _[[Koralis Agro-Collective]]_ claims chartered mineral rights, but can’t enforce them.
    - _[[Dustveil Navigation Syndicate]]_ is smuggling ore off-world through pirate routes.
    - Independent prospectors demand recognition of their “staking claims.”
- **Hook:** Rumors whisper that the “quantum-gold” veins **resonate with spike drives**, hinting at a Precursor origin — and maybe deeper ruins hidden in the badlands.

### 2. **Ashenlight (0205.4)**
- **Type:** Tidally locked near the red dwarf companion star.
- **Features:** One half frozen, one half scorched desert, with a thin twilight habitable band.
- **Use:** Minor settlements of survivalists, scavengers, and outlaw bases.
- **Vibe:** The perfect outlaw hideaway — raiders frequently strike Brass Reach convoys from here.

### 3. **The Lodefield Belt**
- **Type:** Dense asteroid field circling between the two stars.
- **Features:** Some of the richest raw mineral veins in the sector.
- **Hazards:** Frequent collisions, plasma storms from stellar interference.
- **Factions:**
    - **Veyric Resource Group (VRG)** runs semi-legal mining rigs here.
    - Independent belt miners sell ore through back channels to _Virellia Spire Media_ brokers, who love glamorizing the “belt cowboy” lifestyle.

### 4. **Waypoint Gulch (Station)**
- **Type:** A half-finished refueling and trade hub built into a hollow asteroid.
- **Features:** The de facto “boomtown in orbit,” where prospectors, smugglers, and corporate suits meet.
- **Vibe:** A rough-and-tumble mix of saloons, broker houses, and mercenary guild offices. Shootouts are not uncommon.

## 🏴‍☠️ Factions at Play
- **Koralis Agro-Collective ([[0404 - Koralis]]):** Official charter holder. They dispatch “marshal-contractors” to enforce claims but are stretched thin. 
- **Dustveil Navigation Syndicate ([[0003 - Dustveil]]):** Smuggling quantum-gold through pirate spike routes. Their maps are worth as much as the ore itself.
- **Local Prospectors’ Guild:** A shaky union of independent miners on Brass Reach, trying to resist corporate buyouts.
- **Outlaw Gangs:** Salvage convoys roving Brass Reach’s wastelands, often mounted on armored crawler-vehicles. Most infamous: _The Cinder Jackals_.
- **Obsidian Dynamics:** Shadow operatives quietly buying up quantum-gold samples to test for precursor connections.

## ⚠️ Adventure Hooks
1. **Ore Convoy Heist:** The PCs are hired to **escort or raid a shipment** of quantum-gold being hauled across Brass Reach’s desert wastes.
2. **Boomtown Justice:** A prospector who swears he’s found a precursor ruin goes missing. Did outlaws take him, or is Koralis trying to bury the discovery?
3. **Stake Wars:** Rival prospectors hire the PCs to enforce or defend mining claims. Gunfights break out in canyon strongholds.
4. **Belt Gambit:** A VRG mining rig in the Lodefield Belt has gone silent. Is it pirates, a rival corp, or something stranger lurking in the dense asteroid field?
5. **The Resonance:** Strange “songs” can be heard in the ore veins at night, vibrating mining rigs and prospectors’ skulls. Some claim it’s just geological resonance — others fear a precursor beacon is awakening.

## 🎲 Tone & Gameplay
- **On Brass Reach:** Expect _Western boomtown tropes_ — saloons, claim jumpers, lawmen, ambushes in canyons, and dune-hauler chases across the wastes.
- **In Orbit:** The _Mad Max-in-space_ vibe kicks in with salvaged freighters, ramshackle stations, and smugglers bartering stolen ore.
- **At the Core:** The quantum-gold could reshape the sector’s economy, if someone can stabilize its use — making this system the next powder keg.
