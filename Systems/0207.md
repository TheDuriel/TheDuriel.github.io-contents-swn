%% ## **The Malyth Verge**

### Overview

A sector where biology and industry are indistinguishable. Thick, oxygen-rich worlds teem with engineered plantlife, biotech experiments, and corporate testing zones. The spike lanes here are slightly unstable due to localized gravitic eddies — making navigation treacherous without Aleran-calibrated drives.

**Key Traits:**

- High biohazard potential.
    
- Frequent weather disruption and solar bloom events.
    
- Heavy Greenflow Biotics corporate presence.
    
- Verdant Strain enclaves hidden within the wild zones.

## **Primary System: Malyth (0207)**

### **World: Malyth Prime**

**Type:** Jungle World  
**Atmosphere:** Breathable, heavy oxygen content, constant mist  
**Gravity:** 1.1 G  
**Temperature:** Warm, stable tropical climate  
**Population:** ~45 million (official), ~20 million undocumented  
**TL:** 4

#### **Description**

Malyth is a world of endless green — continent-spanning canopies, rivers wider than seas, and a biosphere that never stops growing. Entire mountain ranges are swallowed by moss, and ancient cities crumble under creeping vines.  
Greenflow Biotics has declared much of the planet “reclaimed property,” but vast swathes remain under the de facto control of local Verdant Strain tribes and illegal gene-farmers.

The planet’s high atmosphere glows faintly green at night — a result of engineered spore clouds that circulate nutrients and oxygen across the hemisphere. The effect is breathtaking… and slightly unnerving.

#### **Major Locations**

- **Verdant Core Station (Greenflow HQ):** Massive orbital research station and headquarters of Greenflow Biotics. Tens of thousands of staff live and work here, divided between biotech research, logistics, and medical manufacturing. It resembles a vast ring-shaped garden, with transparent panels showing hydroponic jungles and luminescent algae bays.
    
- **Talarin Basin:** Ground-level jungle megacity serving as Greenflow’s planetary capital. Beneath its canopy layers lie hidden resistance cells and banned research vaults.
    
- **The Bloomscar:** A 2000 km zone of failed terraforming where the biosphere “went rogue” — flesh-trees and acid rains.
    
- **Elen’s Cradle:** Independent Verdant Strains settlement; built into the trees themselves, using organic tech grown from the forest.
    
- **Spore Tower Array:** A network of towering fungal emitters used to spread engineered spores into the atmosphere — and possibly transmit data through bioelectric resonance.

## **Verdant Core Station**

**Type:** Orbital Habitat / Corporate HQ  
**Population:** ~85,000 permanent residents, 20,000 transient staff and visitors  
**Artificial Gravity:** Full  
**Atmosphere:** Oxygen-nitrogen, sterile-filtered  
**TL:** 4+

#### **Structure**

- **Core Ring:** Administration, command, and data archives.
    
- **Outer Habitat Arms:** Living sectors, laboratories, and greenhouses for biotech R&D.
    
- **Docking Spines:** Four enormous mooring structures supporting up to 40 ships at once — from freighters to courier corvettes.
    
- **Garden Belt:** Recreation and oxygen recycling zone, featuring bioengineered “air reefs.”
    
- **Corporate Enclave:** Exclusive residential district for Greenflow’s Board and senior officers.
    
- **Medical Deck:** Houses the **SynCell Research Wing** — Greenflow’s central facility for gene modulation and bio-synthetic interface research.
    

#### **Security**

- 2,000 Greenflow Security personnel (TL4 equipment, bio-armored suits).
    
- Automated defense drones and gas dispersal systems.
    
- A small hangar wing of **Aureline Dynamics** aerospace interceptors under contract for airspace control.

## **Other Systems in Sector 0207**

### **Nareth (0208)**

**Type:** Swamp World  
**Features:** Submerged cities, biotech waste recovery stations, and smugglers.  
**Notes:** Officially listed as a “waste reclamation world,” but most Greenflow shipments pass through here to erase paper trails.

### **Kalar Reach (0307)**

**Type:** Temperate Moon Cluster  
**Features:** Series of moons orbiting a gas giant; a haven for freelancers, black market labs, and retired mercenaries.  
**Notes:** Greenflow and Obsidian Dynamics both fund “unaffiliated” labs here.

### **Thyrax Edge (0106)**

**Type:** Desert / Cliff World  
**Features:** Deep ravines full of buried pretech ruins.  
**Notes:** Aleran Technocracy maintains a small archaeology outpost — Greenflow occasionally “sponsors” digs that uncover new bio-pretech.

## **Factions Present**

|Faction|Interest|
|---|---|
|**Greenflow Biotics**|Primary corporate authority. Controls orbit, biotech patents, and most legitimate trade.|
|**Koralis Agro-Collective**|Economic partner and supplier; tension over genetic ownership rights.|
|**Verdant Strains**|Native eco-religious tribes resisting further biotech colonization.|
|**Obsidian Dynamics**|Operates covert labs seeking “living signal” tech.|
|**Dustveil Navigation Syndicate**|Smuggles rare biomaterials offworld.|
|**Aleran Technocracy**|Provides analytical support for atmospheric data and genetic modeling.|

## **Adventure Hooks**

1. **The Missing Strain:** Greenflow has lost control of an experimental fungal strain that’s rewriting jungle DNA — and possibly the crew’s ship systems.
    
2. **The Verdant Revolt:** A jungle uprising coordinated through bioengineered songbirds disrupts transport networks. The PCs must navigate shifting allegiances.
    
3. **Corporate Theft:** Obsidian Dynamics offers a quiet job — steal a live sample from the SynCell Wing and extract it before it “awakens.”
    
4. **Echo in the Roots:** An Aleran scientist claims the jungle network is transmitting messages — possibly pretech, possibly alive.
    
5. **Quarantine Breach:** A spore quarantine on Verdant Core Station goes wrong, locking the crew in a biohazard nightmare of mutating corridors. %%
