# The Emerald Grave

**Status:** Officially charted, under **strict interstellar oversight**. Access requires permits from multiple factions, and all traffic is closely monitored.
**Star:** A yellow-white main-sequence star, stable, with three habitable-zone worlds.

### 🌍 Key Worlds & Sites

**Verdancia (0208.2) — Jungle Deathworld**
- A hot, wet planet covered in dense, bioluminescent rainforests.
- Flora includes **“Sporeclings”**, parasitic plants that burrow into flesh and neural tissue. Victims often remain alive, controlled by the growth.
- Archeologists excavate cyclopean alien ruins beneath the canopy, but expedition survival rates are abysmal.
- Corporate security quarantines infected survivors, though rumors suggest they’re conducting _weaponization research_.

**Obelara (0208.3) — The Excavation Hub**
- A drier, more temperate planet, heavily colonized as the main base of operations.
- Packed with research stations, warehouses, and orbital docking yards.
- Ruined alien obelisks dot the surface, some covered with fractal inscriptions no one has deciphered.
- Black-market smugglers thrive here, selling relics and bio-samples despite the heavy patrols.

**Korr’s Belt (0208.5) — The Artifact Mines**
- An asteroid belt riddled with abandoned alien constructs.
- Dozens of excavation companies operate here under heavy security.
- A growing movement of “artifact miners” believe the ruins are _alive_ and resent corporate exploitation.

### 🔒 Why It’s Heavily Controlled

- The **Consortium of Archeotechnical Powers (CAP)** enforces strict monopolies on excavation rights.
- Military patrols restrict spike entry vectors, making smuggling dangerous but profitable.
- Discovery of intact alien databanks could unbalance the entire sector’s power structure.

### 🎲 Adventure Hooks

- A faction patron hires PCs to infiltrate Verdancia and extract a researcher who’s uncovered “forbidden” xenotech.
- A smuggler offers to pay them to run parasitic plant samples offworld.
- A rival group wants the PCs to sabotage an excavation site before a major discovery is announced.
- Psychic-sensitive PCs may find themselves influenced by the ruins themselves, which seem to “resonate” with telepaths.
