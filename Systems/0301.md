%% # The Red Expanse

**Status:** Officially mapped during the First Wave of colonization, but sealed under interdiction since the Scream. All spike routes into the sector are patrolled or heavily monitored.

**Star:** A bright red giant, unstable and prone to violent flares.

**Key Features:**
- **Ashen Crown (0301.1):** The inner planet is ringed with colossal orbital ruins — jagged arcs of melted megastructures. They radiate faint energy bursts that disrupt spike calculations.
- **Cinderworld (0301.3):** A scorched, atmosphere-poor rock littered with alien ruins. Explorers who returned (before interdiction) reported impossible non-Euclidean halls and strange gravitational eddies.
- **The Silence Field:** Long-range sensors go dark when aimed at the system’s core, registering only _nothingness_. Some theorize it hides a black hole — others whisper of something manufactured.

**Why It’s Off-Limits:**
- Pretech probes during the Mandate era vanished without trace.
- Early post-Silence expeditions suffered total losses, with the few survivors reporting psychic trauma, hallucinations, and “voices from the void.”
- Current navies enforce a quarantine, declaring it too unstable for navigation.

**Rumors & Hooks:**
- A clandestine faction wants the PCs to smuggle equipment past the blockade.
- A trader offers them a Mandate-era spike map marked with a hidden approach vector.
- Psychic-sensitive characters dream of the Red Expanse, as if something inside is _calling_. %%
