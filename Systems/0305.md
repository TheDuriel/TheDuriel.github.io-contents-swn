# Trinova

**Star:**
- Orange K-type main-sequence star.
- Stable luminosity, long lifespan, supports multiple terrestrial planets and rich asteroid belts.
- Occasional solar storms disrupt communications but are predictable.

### **Planets & Features**

**1. Trinova Prime (0305.1) – Capital and Spaceport World**
- **Tech Level:** 4
- **Population:** ~2.8 billion
- **Surface:** Rocky plains, temperate forests, scattered mountain chains.
- **Government:** Merchant-Administrator Syndicate — a corporatocratic council controlling trade, port facilities, and shipping regulations.
- **Economy:**
    - Major interstellar trade hub, regulating passage of goods from southern arc routes.
    - Specializes in processed ores, mid-tech manufacturing, and refined fuel production.
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Orbital shipyards and port facilities capable of docking large commercial and military ships.
    - Automated defense satellites covering primary trade lanes.
    - Centralized customs and logistics hubs.

**2. Veyra (0305.2) – Orbital Industrial Hub**
- TL4 factory and refinery stations orbiting a minor gas giant.
- Processes raw materials from nearby asteroid belts before shipping to Trinova Prime.
- Automated drones handle most of production, with a small human supervisory team.

**3. Iron Ring (0305.3) – Asteroid Belt**
- Rich in iron, nickel, and trace pretech fragments.
- Mining stations operate semi-independently but report to Trinova Prime.
- Occasional pirate activity — patrolled by local orbital defense.

**4. Lyssal (0305.4) – Research & Navigation Planet**
- TL4 research outpost with spike-navigation labs and communications arrays.
- Population: ~350,000 scientists and technicians.
- Maintains regional sensor grids for asteroid hazards and navigation monitoring.

### **Trade & Route Connections**

- **Major Spike Routes:**
    - Southern Arc: [[0700]] → [[0601]] → [[0502]] → [[0403]] → [[0304]] → [[0305]] → [[0205]] → [[0106]] → [[0007]]
    - Cross-link to Central Spine: 0305 → 0304 → 0204
        
- **Neighboring Systems:**
    - [[0304]] – Sileth (low-tech mining village, depends on Trinova for shipping)
    - [[0306]] – Broken Spine (minor waypoint, lightly patrolled)
    - [[0205]] – Verdant Ark (mega-structure connection for regional trade)

### **Security & Military**

- **Orbital Defense Grid:**
    - TL4 frigates, corvettes, and automated missile batteries guard trade lanes.
    - Defense satellites provide rapid interception for piracy or border incursions.
- **Local Enforcement:**
    - Merchant Syndicate Patrols enforce tariffs and shipping regulations.
    - Occasional privateer contracts hired to deter frontier pirates.

### **Adventure Hooks**

1. **Pirate Interference:** Pirates in the Iron Ring threaten shipments; PCs may be hired to hunt or negotiate.
2. **Trade Espionage:** Rival syndicates attempt to steal shipment manifests or intercept cargo.
3. **Pretech Discovery:** Mining operations uncover a fragment of TL5+ tech, sparking corporate and government interest.
4. **Frontier Diplomacy:** Low-tech neighbors like Sileth or Lyssal rely on Trinova for survival, creating political tension if trade is restricted.
### **Flavor & Setting Notes**

- **Culture:** Mercantile and pragmatic, focused on efficiency and wealth.
- **Politics:** Corporatocratic council balances competing merchant interests; disputes resolved via arbitration or economic pressure rather than violence.
- **Environment:** Urbanized orbital hubs contrast with sparsely populated surface regions; industrial smoke and orbital traffic are constant.
- **Society:** High dependence on trade routes and mining; frontier systems look to Trinova as a source of goods, protection, and stability.
