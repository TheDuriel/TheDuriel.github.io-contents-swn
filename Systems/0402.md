## ü™ê Worlds & Features

### 1. **Khazar (0402.2)** ‚Äî _‚ÄúThe Dune Forge‚Äù_
- **Type:** Arid terrestrial planet, dominated by vast salt flats, shifting dune seas, and rugged badlands.
- **Atmosphere:** Thin, breathable with filtration. Frequent sandstorms strong enough to strip paint off hulls.
- **Resources:**
    - **Volatic Crystals**: rare energy-reactive minerals buried deep beneath salt flats. They resonate with spike-drives and are a critical component in drive stabilizers.
    - Small aquifers and rare oases dot the deserts, jealously guarded by local populations.
- **Settlements:**
    - Stationary cities are rare; most large-scale operations are **mobile carrier platforms** crawling across the surface.
    - Independent settlers cluster around wells, small domes, or scavenger camps.

### 2. **Zyden Belt**
- **Type:** Asteroid belt
- **Use:** Source of common metals and fuel ice, mined by small syndicate operators and Helion subsidiary rigs.
- **Hazards:** Constant micro-meteoroid swarms, making mining highly dangerous without hardened shields.

### 3. **Veyric Station (Orbital)**
- **Type:** Corporate hub in Khazar orbit.
- **Use:** Acts as customs, export, and refueling station.
- **Vibe:** A mix of sterile corporate control decks and riotous black-market docks beneath them.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Factions in 0402

- **Tarkos Extraction Limited:** The dominant player, but spread thin with Crawlers operating in competing regions.
- **Free Miners of Khazar:** Loosely organized prospectors who scavenge abandoned Tarkos sites or raid weak Crawlers.
- **Greenflow Biotics (0207):** Operating small research enclaves to exploit hardy desert flora for biopharma applications. They see Tarkos as ecologically catastrophic.
- **Local Tribes (‚ÄúSalt-Bloods‚Äù):** Semi-nomadic people tied to oasis wells. Hostile toward Tarkos but occasionally cut deals with Free Miners.

## üé≤ Adventure Hooks

1. **The Fallen Crawler:** One of Tarkos‚Äôs massive platforms broke down in a salt basin and was abandoned ‚Äî but its reactor and cargo remain. Multiple groups race to salvage it. PCs are hired to get there first.
2. **Water Wars:** Tarkos moves a Crawler dangerously close to a Salt-Blood oasis. PCs are contracted to mediate ‚Äî or enforce one side‚Äôs will.
3. **Crystal Heist:** Free Miners want a strike team (the PCs) to infiltrate a Tarkos Crawler and steal a newly found **volatic crystal seam map.**
4. **Desert Storm:** A superstorm is approaching Khazar‚Äôs equatorial mining fields. PCs must evacuate a station or protect a Crawler against both the storm and opportunistic raiders.
5. **Corporate War:** Veyric Resource Group (0105) considers Tarkos too reckless and plans to muscle into 0402. PCs could be hired for espionage, sabotage, or negotiations.

## üé® Tone & Imagery

- **Crawlers:** Rolling megastructures the size of small cities, bristling with cranes, comm towers, and massive treads or hover-skirt engines.
- **The Desert:** Burning skies, endless salt plains, sandstorms sweeping across colossal wreckage.
- **Culture:** Harsh workers in dust-stained uniforms, corporate foremen in gleaming towers, scavengers welding patchwork vehicles to trail the Crawlers.

### **The Carrier Platforms (‚ÄúCrawlers‚Äù)**

- Massive **land-borne fortress-platforms** that mix oil rigs, aircraft carriers, and desert crawlers.
- Each carries up to 1,000 personnel: workers, security, drones, surveyors.
- Self-sufficient with mobile reactors, spike-drive component for relocation, and heavy defense batteries.
- Slowly move across the desert to chase mineral seams and aquifers.
- Locals call them **‚ÄúSand-Fortresses.‚Äù**
