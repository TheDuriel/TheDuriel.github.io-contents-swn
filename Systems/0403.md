### 0403.1 Kavarna
- **Type:** Gas Giant
- **Position:** Mid
- **Size Class:** Large
- **Gravity:** High
- **Atmosphere:** None
- **Temperature:** Hot
- **Radiation Level:** Mild
- **Moons:** 14, 3 with stations

Permanent auroral storms visible from orbit — miners call them “the Lantern Veins.”
Kavarna’s dense radiation belt makes it both a navigational hazard and a shield. **Pirates and black market haulers** often use the magnetosphere to hide from long-range sensors.

### 0403.2 Ironfold Cluster
- **Type:** Asteroid Cluster
- **Position:** Kavarna Second Lagrange Point
- **Size Class:** Medium
- **Radiation Level:** Safe
- **Resource Density:** Nickel, cobalt, osmium, iridium, magnetic silicates.

#### Ironfold Mining Stations
- **Tech Level:** TL5
- **Population Size:** Hundreds
- **System Authority / Faction:** [[Tarkos Extraction Limited]]
- **Law Level:** Lawless / Corporate

**Logistics**
- **Facilities:** Mining operation
- **Docking Options:** Docking / Surface Landing
- **Refueling Availability:** No
- **Communications:** Intermittent
- **Defenses:** None

The Ironfold Cluster is a maze of tumbling rock and debris — fragments of a shattered moon.  
Half a dozen **Tarkos Extraction rigs** still drift here, abandoned or cannibalized.  
Rumors persist that at least two of these have been converted into **pirate refit docks**.

### 0403.3 Burnside Relay
- **Tech Level:** TL4
- **Population Size:** None
- **System Authority / Faction:** Exchange, [[Koralis Agro-Collective]]
- **Law Level:** Corporate

**Logistics**
- **Facilities:** Relay Station.
- **Docking Options:** Docking
- **Refueling Availability:** No
- **Communications:** Reliable
- **Defenses:** Automated

Maintains FTL comms bridge between sectors [[0402]] ↔ [[0404]].
Burnside is mostly automated, but sometimes hosts a skeleton crew of technicians.  
It’s considered neutral ground — even pirates tend to leave it alone, fearing Exchange sanctions.

### 0403.4 Crossbay Exchange Hub
- **Tech Level:** TL4
- **Population Size:** Thousands
- **System Authority / Faction:** [[Concordant Exchange]]
- **Law Level:** Corporate

**Logistics**
- **Service Prices:** Expensive x1.5
- **Facilities:** Docking arms, repair bays, arbitration courts, freight storage, taverns, and a central Exchange board.
- **Docking Options:** Drydocking
- **Refueling Availability:** Yes
- **Communications:** Reliable
- **Defenses:** Automated / Patrols

The **Crossbay Hub** is the lifeline of the system — the only semi-stable stop for refuel, food, or legitimate salvage contracts.  
Every crew passing through [[0403]] comes here, willingly or not. It’s a rough place, kept civil by the Exchange’s monopoly on air, fuel, and security.

### Current Situation
- **Tarkos Extraction Limited** still holds mineral rights but rarely patrols — their claim-station at _Kavarna-6_ is automated and minimally staffed.
- **Independent miners** and **small Free Merchant outfits** make up the majority of traffic.
- **Greenflow Biotics** occasionally passes through, citing “environmental surveys,” though few believe it’s just that.
- **Pirate cells**, often out of Sector [[0406]], use abandoned stations to repair or retrofit ships. Some cooperate loosely under the banner of the **Ironfold Collective**, a non-official smuggler syndicate.
