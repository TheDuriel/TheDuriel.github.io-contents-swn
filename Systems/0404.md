# Koralis

**Star:**
- Yellow G-type main-sequence star, slightly cooler than Sol.
- Stable, long-lived, supports multiple habitable worlds.
- Occasional solar flares, mild but enough to disrupt communications for hours.

### **Planets & Features**

**1. Koralis Prime (0404.1) – Capital & Agricultural World**
- **Tech Level:** 4
- **Population:** ~3.5 billion
- **Surface:** Fertile plains, river deltas, temperate forests, and volcanic highlands.
- **Government:** Unified Senate — representatives from major agricultural guilds, industrial corporations, and research institutes.
- **Economy:**
    - Major exporter of staple crops, processed foods, and mid-tech industrial components.
    - Central hub for regional trade along the West–East spine.
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Orbital habitats, starports, and automated trade depots.
    - Regional customs and taxation offices.
    - Defense satellites guarding trade lanes.

**2. Verdant Ring (0404.2) – Mining & Industrial Belt**
- Rich asteroid belt with iron, nickel, and minor pretech fragments.
- Mining colonies and automated refineries feed Koralis Prime’s industrial needs.
- Semi-autonomous operations supervised by corporate liaisons.

**3. Altara (0404.3) – Research & Education Planet**
- TL4 research hub with universities, observatories, and engineering labs.
- Population: ~600,000 researchers, engineers, and students.
- Focus: agricultural technology, energy efficiency, and spike navigation calibration.

**4. Minor Moon – Orbital Satellite Network**
- Provides communication relays, orbital surveillance, and early warning for incoming traffic.
- Mostly automated; small maintenance crews rotate monthly.

### **Trade & Route Connections**

- **Major Spike Routes:**
    - West–East Spine: [[0204]] → [[0404]] → [[0604]]
    - Cross-link to neighboring systems: 0405 → 0505
- **Neighboring Systems:**
    - [[0204]] – Dyson Fragment (strategic and trade connection)
    - [[0604]] – Lyranth (naval and industrial partner)
    - [[0405]] – Branth (smaller agricultural client world)

### **Security & Military**

- **Orbital Defense Grid:**
    - TL4 frigates, corvettes, and automated missile batteries protecting trade lanes.
    - Satellite sensors track spike traffic and detect smuggling.
- **Local Enforcement:**
    - Koralis planetary patrols maintain order and manage trade compliance.
    - Merchant guild security forces help protect convoys to neighboring systems.

### **Adventure Hooks**

1. **Trade Dispute:** Branth or other nearby TL2–TL3 worlds bypass Koralis’ tariffs; PCs may be hired to enforce trade agreements or sabotage rivals.
2. **Piracy Threat:** Raiders target the Verdant Ring’s mining operations; PCs could intercept or negotiate.
3. **Corporate Espionage:** Rival industrial corporations attempt to steal agricultural tech from Altara labs.
4. **Pretech Discovery:** A fragment in the mining belt hints at TL5+ technology, drawing attention from both legitimate and shady parties.

### **Flavor & Setting Notes**

- **Culture:** Cooperative, pragmatic, and trade-focused; strong emphasis on maintaining stability in surrounding systems.
- **Politics:** Senate balances interests of agriculture, industry, and research; political intrigue centers on resource allocation and trade policies.
- **Environment:** Fertile lands contrasted with heavily industrial orbital stations.
- **Society:** TL4 technology supports a thriving economy; neighboring low-tech worlds rely on Koralis for exports and guidance.
