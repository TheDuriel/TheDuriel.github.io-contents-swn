# Volyograd System

**Star:** K-type orange dwarf, stable but faint.  
**Astrography:** A tangled system dominated by **multiple asteroid belts, planetoid clusters, and debris fields**, making navigation treacherous but resource-rich.

## 🪐 Major Features

1. **The Tchaikovsky Belt**
    - A massive, dense asteroid belt rich in nickel-iron and water ice.
    - Officially licensed to **Koralis mining guilds**, but plagued by pirate attacks.
    - Navigation hazard: shifting gravity eddies and micro-debris make long hauls a nightmare.
2. **Petrograd Cluster**
    - Several large planetoids forming a gravitationally unstable cluster.
    - Hollowed out and converted into **hidden pirate dens**.
    - Stories claim at least one has a working **Precursor reactor** powering pirate fleets.
3. **Oblivion Veil**
    - A chaotic debris field, remnants of a shattered moon.
    - Thick electromagnetic interference scrambles sensors.
    - Smugglers and pirates use it as cover to ambush ships.
    - Rumors of “ghost transmissions” inside — possible alien ruins or old war wreckage.
4. **Polyarna Station**
    - A battered, unofficial **free station** carved into a captured asteroid.
    - Acts as neutral ground between pirates, smugglers, and fringe traders.
    - Market thrives on black-market arms, stolen cargo, and illegal spike fuel.

## 🌍 Colonies & Habitats

- **Kazan Prospect (Mining Colony)**
    - A Koralis-sponsored outpost of ~7,000 workers in the Tchaikovsky Belt.
    - Protected by a handful of underpaid mercenaries, often at the mercy of raids.
    - On the brink of collapse due to repeated pirate sieges.
- **New Rusalka (Habitat Station)**
    - A semi-legitimate trading hub in the Petrograd Cluster.
    - Officially “independent,” but in reality run by pirate guilds.
    - Outsiders can buy weapons, safe passage contracts, or stolen goods here — if they can pay.

## ⚠️ Adventure Hooks

1. **Rescue or Ransom:** A freighter carrying critical supplies for **Koralis Agro-Collective** has been seized by the Corsairs — the PCs are hired to negotiate or steal it back.
2. **Treasure in the Veil:** Rumors suggest an intact Precursor probe or AI core drifts within the **Oblivion Veil**, but both pirates and corporations want it first.
3. **Spy Games:** The **Aleris Systems Collective** quietly hires the PCs to map pirate hideouts — with explicit instructions _not_ to get caught.
4. **Civil War Brewing:** Some Corsair captains are tired of Markov’s leadership and plan a coup. PCs might get entangled in the succession struggle.
5. **Smuggler’s Run:** The only profitable trade here involves running illegal cargo through **pirate-controlled lanes**. Can the PCs build a reputation as “untouchables”?

## 🔭 Sector Role

System 0406 serves as:
- A **pirate choke point** along the Central Spine, threatening convoys between **Koralis ([[0404]])** and **Aurix ([[0505]])**.
- A **lawless frontier** where PCs can deal with pirates, smugglers, and shadow corporations.
- A **sandbox for high-risk jobs**: asteroid mining, salvage, espionage, or negotiations.
