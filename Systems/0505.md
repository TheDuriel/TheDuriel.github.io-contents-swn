# Aurix

**Star:**
- Yellow-white main-sequence star, slightly brighter than Sol.
- Stable, long-lived, minimal solar activity.
- Supports multiple habitable worlds, asteroid belts, and orbital trade hubs.

### **Planets & Features**

**1. Aurix Prime (0505.1) – Capital & Trade Hub**
- **Tech Level:** 4
- **Population:** ~4.1 billion
- **Surface:** Rolling plains, river valleys, scattered cities and industrial zones.
- **Government:** Planetary Governor — semi-autonomous under regional mandate; strong merchant influence.
- **Economy:**
    - Trade and logistics hub for central spine and southern arc routes.
    - Exports: refined metals, fuel, mid-tech manufactured goods, and processed food.
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Starports, orbital habitats, automated logistics depots.
    - Customs offices controlling spike-lane access.
    - Defensive orbital platforms monitoring trade routes.

**2. The Crucible Gate (0505.2) – Precursor Mega-Structure & Pilgrimage Site**
- **Structure:** Vast, dormant ring-shaped spike gate encircling a hollow space roughly 1,000 km in diameter.
- **Current Use:**
    - A **fortress-monastery** occupies the inner ring, housing both religious orders and scholars who study the gate.
    - Pilgrimage site for those who revere the gate as a relic of a precursor species.
- **Tech Level:** TL6+ (precursor, dormant)
- **Mystery & Plot Hooks:**
    - Some factions believe it could connect beyond the known sector if reactivated.
    - Secretive expeditions attempt to unlock its power; results are unpredictable.
    - Dangerous internal environments: automated defense drones, unstable gravity fields, and remnants of ancient AI.

**3. Talara (0505.3) – Industrial Satellite**
- TL4 automated refineries and production plants.
- Processes ores from the Obelix Belt and exports to Aurix Prime and neighboring systems.

**4. Obelix Belt (0505.4) – Asteroid Mining Zone**
- Rich in iron, nickel, and minor pretech fragments.
- Mining colonies operate semi-autonomously but report to Aurix Prime.
- Occasionally raided by pirates; orbital defense patrols mitigate losses.

**5. Lyricon (0505.5) – Administrative & Research Satellite**
- TL4 orbital station housing planetary administration, customs, and spike-navigation labs.
- Coordinates sector-wide trade and security operations.

### **Trade & Route Connections**

- **Major Spike Routes:**
    - West–East Spine: [[0405]] → [[0505]] → [[0605]]
    - Southern Arc: [[0502]] → [[0505]] → [[0608]]
- **Neighboring Systems:**
    - [[0502]] – Yorra (TL2–3 agricultural client)
    - [[0604]] – Lyranth (naval/industrial coordination)
    - [[0404]] – Koralis (regional trade partner)
    - [[0204]] – Dyson Fragment (via central spine, research and logistics link)

### **Security & Military**

- **Aurix Orbital Defense Grid:**
    - TL4 frigates, corvettes, and automated missile batteries protect spike lanes, orbital infrastructure, and the Crucible Gate.
- **Fortress-Monastery Defense:**
    - Monks maintain internal defenses; some sections contain TL6+ automated precursor defense drones.
- **Local Enforcement:**
    - Planetary patrols and merchant guild security enforce trade and customs regulations.

### **Adventure Hooks**

1. **Gate Exploration:** Scholars and factions attempt to unlock the Crucible Gate; PCs may need to investigate, sabotage, or protect an expedition.
2. **Pilgrimage Intrigue:** Religious factions clash inside the fortress-monastery over interpretation of the gate’s purpose.
3. **Pretech Discovery:** Mining or orbital surveys reveal fragments of precursor tech tied to the gate.
4. **Frontier Smuggling:** Pirates exploit trade traffic near the Crucible Gate, hiding in its gravitational anomalies.
5. **Political Tension:** Neighboring TL4 systems may attempt to assert influence over the gate for strategic advantage.

### **Flavor & Setting Notes**

- **Culture:** Mercantile, politically savvy, with a mix of religious reverence and scientific curiosity focused on the gate.
- **Politics:** Governor manages trade and logistics, balancing merchant guilds, regional powers, and religious orders.
- **Environment:** Surface plains for agriculture, orbital hubs for trade, and a massive inner ring of the Crucible Gate housing a fortress-monastery.
- **Society:** Aurix serves as both the **commercial heart** of its region and the **spiritual/research center** surrounding a TL6+ precursor artifact.
