# Lyranth

**Star:**
- Orange K-type main-sequence star.
- Stable, long-lived, with predictable luminosity.
- Minor solar storms every 8–10 years; mostly affects orbital sensor grids.

### **Planets & Features**

**1. Lyranth Prime (0604.1) – Capital & Naval Hub**
- **Tech Level:** 4
- **Population:** ~3.6 billion
- **Surface:** Temperate oceans, scattered continents, mountain ranges, and urban centers.
- **Government:** Military Council with civilian advisory board; prioritizes sector security and trade protection.
- **Economy:**
    - Industrial production of ships, weapons, and mid-tech manufacturing.
    - Hub for regional trade, defense contracts, and spike-lane monitoring.
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Orbital shipyards producing frigates, corvettes, and cargo vessels.
    - Defensive orbital platforms covering spike lanes.
    - Naval academy and fleet coordination centers.

**2. Aurix Belt Outpost (0604.2)**
- TL4 orbital refineries and repair stations servicing ships from Aurix and surrounding systems.
- Automated drone maintenance with small human supervisory teams.

**3. Obsidian Reach (0604.3) – Industrial Planet**
- TL4 manufacturing world focused on heavy machinery, ship components, and industrial tools.
- Population: ~900,000; mainly engineers and factory workers.
- Supplies the Lyranth fleet and neighboring TL4 hubs like Aurix and Koralis.

**4. Sentinel Moons (0604.4 & 0604.5)**
- Two small moons with orbital defense platforms, sensor arrays, and early-warning beacons.
- Staffed primarily by rotating naval crews.

**5. Harkan Asteroid Field (0604.6)**
- Rich in iron, nickel, and industrial-grade silicates.
- Small mining stations provide raw materials for shipbuilding.
- Occasionally patrolled to deter smuggling or pirate activity.

### **Trade & Route Connections**

- **Major Spike Routes:**
    - West–East Spine: [[0404]] → [[0604]] → [[0705]]
    - Southern Arc: [[0601]] → [[0604]] → [[0608]]
- **Neighboring Systems:**
    - [[0505]] – Aurix (trade and strategic coordination)
    - [[0601]] – Lhoris (low-tech agricultural trade)
    - [[0705]] – Virellia (cultural and political coordination)
    - [[0404]] – Koralis (industrial partner)

### **Security & Military**

- **Orbital Defense Grid:**
    - TL4 frigates and corvettes patrol spike lanes and maintain sovereignty over the system.
    - Automated missile batteries and sensor arrays cover key orbital points.
- **Naval Operations:**
    - Fleet coordination center on Lyranth Prime manages regional patrols.
    - Shipyards capable of producing replacement vessels for neighboring TL4 hubs.

### **Adventure Hooks**

1. **Pirate Incursion:** Frontier pirates threaten Harkan Asteroid Field; PCs may be hired to intercept them.
2. **Espionage:** Rival TL4 powers attempt to infiltrate naval shipyards to steal designs or sabotage production.
3. **Fleet Exercise:** PCs may be involved in fleet maneuvers, escort missions, or training exercises.
4. **Pretech Discovery:** Mining in Harkan uncovers TL5+ fragments; the Council may keep it secret or hire adventurers to investigate.
5. **Trade Dispute:** Aurix or Koralis merchants clash over contracts; PCs may be mediators, saboteurs, or enforcers.

### **Flavor & Setting Notes**

- **Culture:** Highly disciplined, pragmatic, and militarily oriented.
- **Politics:** Military Council dominates policy; civilian advisory board ensures trade and research needs are balanced.
- **Environment:** Industrialized capital with major orbital and planetary infrastructure; natural landscapes preserved on outer continents.
- **Society:** TL4 technology enables a powerful regional fleet, industrial manufacturing, and strong coordination with other TL4 hubs, making Lyranth a **strategic keystone system**.
