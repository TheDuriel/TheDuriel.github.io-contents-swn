# **Charybess Veil**

**Star Type:** G-type main sequence, slightly unstable  
**Sector Role:** Hazardous system known for a lethal anomaly and a cultic ocean world.  
**Tone:** Foreboding, storm-lashed, and alien.

## ⚠️ Astrological Anomaly — _The Maw of Charybess_

- **Type:** A roving gravitational storm, similar to a micro black hole but surrounded by **writhing arcs of exotic energy**.
- **Behavior:** Not fixed in place — it drifts unpredictably through the system, swallowing ships, asteroids, and even moons.
- **Effect:** Navigational charts are only good for a few months at best. Any spike-drive approach into 0609 is high-risk without updated telemetry.
- **Theories:**
    - Some claim it’s a failed Precursor experiment in _“dimensional tunneling.”_
    - Others whisper it is **alive**, and feeds selectively on psionic resonance.
    - A small sect within Eidolynx Media insists the Maw is a _“stage-light of the cosmos,”_ a cosmic audience staring back.

## 🪐 Key World — **Thalassa (0609.2)**

- **Type:** Ocean planet, 98% surface covered in churning seas.
- **Climate:** Perpetual storm systems, massive lightning arcs, tidal waves cresting kilometers high.
- **Settlements:**
    - Built into **floating fortress-arks** and **semi-submerged domes** tethered to the seabed.
    - Most structures rely on **psionic dampeners** to protect against “storm-songs” — strange psychic impressions carried in thunder and surf.
- **Exports:** Rare **biocrystals** formed in the guts of enormous crustaceans. These resonate strongly with psionic energy, making them invaluable to research and dangerous in the wrong hands.

## 🦀 The Cult of the Great Crab

- **Belief:** Thalassa’s psionic researchers, originally tasked with studying biocrystals, fell into **mystical reverence** for a colossal, barely-seen crustacean entity they call _The Great Crab_.
- **Theology:**
    - The Great Crab is seen as both **patron and predator** — a being that scuttles between dimensions, surfacing only during the fiercest storms.
    - Psionics believe their visions during storm-songs are **“claw-marks of the divine.”**
    - Worship is half research, half ecstatic trance.
- **Practice:**
    - Researchers undergo **“Shell Trials”** — isolation in storm domes where lightning storms induce psionic visions.
    - Cultists wear **segmented shell-armor**, etched with crab claws and wave motifs.
    - The holiest rite is **“Crab Walking”** — a ritualized gait performed during storms to align one’s mind with the Great Crab’s dimensional rhythm.
- **Structure:** A loose hierarchy called the **Shell Choir**, with the **High Carapace** as leader. Their psionic rites sometimes broadcast across system comms, disrupting nav buoys.

## ⚖️ Factions at Play

1. **The Shell Choir (Thalassa):** Psionic cult-researchers who worship the Great Crab. They control biocrystal exports and fiercely guard storm-dome sanctuaries.
2. **Obsidian Dynamics ([[0309]]):** Maintaining covert labs on Thalassa, trying to extract and weaponize biocrystals. They avoid cult attention where possible.
3. **Koralis Agro-Collective ([[0404]]):** Operates floating farms on calmer seas. They see the cult as an unstable nuisance but tolerate them for now.
4. **Wayfarers’ Brotherhood:** Pilgrims occasionally detour here, believing the Maw of Charybess is the Crucible Gate’s “dark sibling.”

## 🎲 Adventure Hooks

1. **The Storm Vault:** PCs are hired to retrieve a shipment of biocrystals from a **storm-battered dome-lab** whose researchers vanished after claiming to “hear the Great Crab.”
2. **The Maw Hunt:** A daring corporation wants live telemetry from the Maw’s interior. They need a crew reckless enough to drop probes _inside the anomaly._
3. **Crab Prophet:** A rogue psion has emerged from the Shell Choir, claiming the Great Crab demands Thalassa’s seas be “boiled” to free it. PCs must stop or aid them.
4. **The Crab’s Shadow:** PCs’ spike drive begins resonating with the Maw, drawing them toward it unless they can find a psionic dampening solution.
5. **Faction War:** Obsidian Dynamics and the Shell Choir clash violently after Obsidian captures a “juvenile crab-titan.” PCs may get caught in the middle — or be paid to turn the tide.

## 🎨 Tone & Imagery

- **Sky:** Endless thunderheads flashing violet lightning across black seas.  
- **At Sea:** Floating fortress-arks lashed with chains, cultists chanting psionic hymns through storm-songs.
- **The Maw:** A swirling black void fringed with **spiraling auroras**, always moving, always hungry.
