# The Lost System: **Nadir’s Veil**

**Coordinates:** _Unmapped, only reachable by unstable spike drive trajectories. Rumors place it “beyond [[0709]],” but no official registry lists it._

**Star:** A dim red subgiant, oddly shrouded in a veil of ionized dust that cloaks long-range sensors.

**Worlds/Features:**
- **Shroudworld:** A tidally-locked planet perpetually wreathed in auroras and static storms. Surface colonies exist in the twilight zone, but many are abandoned ruins.
- **The Black Array:** A constellation of silent orbital pylons of alien origin, arranged in precise geometric patterns. They occasionally emit pulses on unknown frequencies.
- **Frozen Fleet:** A cluster of derelict pretech warships drifting in-system, their hulls scarred but preserved by vacuum. No registry matches their designs.

**Why It’s Hidden:**
- No stable spike coordinates exist; entry requires rare astrogation data or experimental drive modifications.
- Reports of severe psychic feedback plague navigators who attempt entry. Some return… most don’t.
- Factions deny its existence publicly, but certain covert agencies _definitely_ send expeditions.

**Adventure Hooks:**
- A recovered spike recorder from a lost ship reveals partial jump data pointing to Nadir’s Veil.
- A faction patron hires the PCs to recover alien tech “no one will admit exists.”
- Survivors found drifting in space claim to have _lived for decades_ in the Veil, though their ship’s logs show only weeks have passed.
