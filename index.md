This folder contains campaign nodes for an in person campaign for Stars Without Numbers. Hosted at https://www.spelkollektivet.com/

Some pages may contain spoilers. But your characters would definitely know:
* General faction information, like their nature, size, and services.
* General system information, like the stars, planets, major stations / civilization centers.

Your characters might not know:
* Specific details about faction members, goals, or assets.
* Specific details about planetary hazards, security levels, or the lawfulness of a system.

The characters folder contains a copy of the ship sheet, as well as my notes for individual player characters.
